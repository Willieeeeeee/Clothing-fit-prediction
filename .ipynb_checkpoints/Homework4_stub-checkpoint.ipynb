       "  \"This book is part of a series of graphic accounts of significant modern philosophers and ideas. The original idea behind the series was that you could educate through a combination of image and crisp short summaries of the life and history of complicated people and concepts. \\n This is both absurd and helpful. None of these books (largely produced in the post-modern fervour of the 1990s) can do more than skim the surface of a subject. Ideas can be so foreshortened that they are meaningless to the uneducated subject. The graphics are often crude but they serve their purpose, only rarely adding to the obscurities instead of enlightening us. \\n On the other hand, they offer two hours (approximately) of comic book summary of the main tenets of a thinker or movement with valuable pointers to further reading or study. They are very useful and entertaining in that context. \\n To a great extent, they have been superseded by the internet. Wikipedia and a basic Google search can deliver similar short reliable summaries with links at the click of a mouse but they still have their role in opening up the minds of many people who would never otherwise come up against these ideas. \\n Personally, I am a great admirer of Nietzsche who, though not flawless, provided us with some very fundamental insights into human psychology and engaged deeply with some of the toughest metaphysical and other philosophical problems encountered in Western philosophy. \\n We have long since left Marx and Freud behind, largely because of the excesses of their followers, but we have scarcely touched the surface of Nietzsche's contribution to thought even if his analyses may never be fully acceptable in 'polite society'. He is the most inconvenient of philosophers. \\n There is no point in summarising a summary account of his life and thinking. I have my own theory of his 'madness' (about which, of course, doubts have been raised) so if you are not interested in this, do not read on and just make a judgement on the book on the basis of your need. \\n The probability is of a serious nervous breakdown and mental instability but it strikes me that it is not accidental that it was triggered by a horse being beaten by a man in public. \\n Nietzsche's thought derived in part from his absolute refusal to compromise in trying to understand the reality of 'herd' behaviour (in effect, social psychology) and in communicating his findings about that behaviour to a world that, by his own analysis, had too much at stake in seeing the bones beneath the skin. \\n It was not a truly free society - an intellectual elite acted as a thin veneer of public morality and of ideology within a system that remained fundamentally brutal in its demands for service from its members. The masters, indeed, had become slaves to their slaves in order to maintain order, both social and cultural. \\n Nietzsche was the liberationist of the individual against this system but was quite definitely one without much of an understanding of the components of the 'herd' outside his class. He thought that a man of the elite (he is ambiguous about women) could liberate himself from the obligations imposed by the collective from below without perhaps understanding that the elite had a great deal of material interest in creating this system of self-policing in a complex industrial society. Unlike Marx, Nietzsche clearly did not understand how industrial society was different from the pagan world of the past. \\n Within such a bourgeois culture, faced with a threat from within their own community, people like Nietzsche are handled not through attack but through a policy of isolation - as inconvenient and 'not to the point'. \\n This how the intelligentsia operates in any case, through systematic exclusion of those who do not accept the prevailing ideology. I am sure that many fine minds, with perhaps similar if much less developed ideas, have languished in obscurity unable, without leisure, to record their thinking, even in the lower ranks of bourgeois Germany. \\n Nietzsche was both lucky and unlucky in living at the cusp of a new age. On the one hand, there was sufficient freedom from cultural authority to enable free expression. On the other, there was an insufficient plurality of cultural communications for that free expression, at least in his life time, that might counter the dead weight of the existing German elite. \\n Part of Nietzsche's famous breach with Wagner derived from anger at the great artist's slow and steady absorption into this dominant culture rather than challenge it with a new 'pagan' affirmation of life. Wagner abandoned the Nibelungenlied for Parzifal. \\n Nietzsche can occasionally sound as if he is pessimistic in this context (which is certainly the view of most persons faced with the grim Doctrine of the Eternal Return) but, in fact, his entire work cannot be understood except as an attempt to affirm life in the face of the much grimmer pessimism of Schopenhauer. Schopenhauer's miserabilism might be regarded as the natural thinking response to the flummery of Christian duty but one that, as in Wagner's case, equally permitted submission to its demands. Amongst the elaborate lies we weave to keep ourselves 'sane', Wagner appeared to choose Schopenhauerian negation and Nietzsche never forgave him for this. \\n Nietzsche used up vasts amount of psychic energy in seeking out his own 'truth' (he never accepted that there could be a 'Truth') and his 'truth', which was based on a rigorous stripping away of layers of social illusion and convenient irrationalities (including the illusion of rationality itself), could only have value either to someone in a similar position to him (a bourgeois mind with a mission) or to a society that felt itself free to experiment with freedom. Nietzsche took his vision, often writing his books in a matter of days after months of cogitation, and laid it out remorselessly to his (then) non-readers in a drive for self-exploration that a critic might consider as neurotic in itself. \\n His thinking was a necessity, not a desire, and the resultant body of work, obscure though it may be in places, is one of the greatest creative uses of the mind in human history. It proved a revolution in thinking that spread first amongst intellectuals overseas, then returned to Germany in a bastardised form (irrelevant to all those truly interested in the thought). Once purged of its more absurd followers, bit ecame a central source for nearly all modern continental philosophy and for a critique of power that (in my view) has now become truly salient in the social conditions arising from rapid change in the technology of communications. \\n The point is that Nietzsche described the social world more accurately than any preceding philosopher and placed it in a metaphysical context. His observations now seem in closest accord with the dark findings of the cognitive scientists and the social psychologists about how we humans actually operate and command the world. \\n Many Enlightenment-trained intellectuals will run around like frightened rabbits and then sink into a gloom at Milgram's experiments or the Holocaust as if their thinking will change anything about these things. Nietzsche would not have been surprised in either case for it is just how he saw that the 'herd' operates and the educated elite responds. Even now, Western liberal thinking has still not come to terms with the death of Reason as substitute for Revelation and is turning to 'nudge' as its last desperate fling at dealing with inconvenient truths. \\n Where he was lucky in his legacy is precisely in not being acceptable too soon. Marx saw Marxism boom and bust as it seized power, perverted power and then died because Marx's undoubted insights were hobbled by Engels' scientific materialism. Freud was to have a similar problem with Freudians who became sucked, like Marxists, into complex and fixed ideologies of mind that soon came unstuck, in a perverse reversal of what happened to Marxism, by not being scientific enough! \\n Nietzche, on the other hand, was followed initially by maniacs who seriously perverted his message (the malign racial nationalism of his sister and of German radical nationalists) but who did this to such a ridiculous degree that his work not merely survived but emerged strengthened. 'For what does not kill, strengthens' in his often quoted aphorism. Nietzsche's approach to life survives precisely because it is individualistic and anti-ideological. It cannot be systematised like Marxism yet it embodies its critique of Reason in the terms of reasoning itself. It out-reasons Reason and brilliantly and entertainingly at that. \\n This will soon bring us back to the flogged horse, so be patient. Because the flaw in Nietzsche's thinking arises from the conditions in which he did his thinking. You must imagine a man isolated but following the logic of his own thought in a way that others might have considered 'mad' well before his diagnosed 'madness'. Yet the brilliance and power of reasoning and determination could not permit such a judgement reasonably while he still thought and wrote. However, this man may have been hard on the human race's capacity for illusion but he was also hard on himself. \\n He knew the logic of the situation. He was seeing into the heart of the human condition. Evolution must eventually see humanity negate itself completely in its illusions (as many post-modern French thinkers seem to suggest is happening) or 'become' something else. This latter is the real 'trans-human' message behind the 'ubermensch', an individual transformation that evolves into a species-transformation or else sees humanity as an evolutionary dead end for humanity as a whole. Some may now expect the 'ubermensch' to be found in the world of artificial intelligence, raising the interesting conundrum of which sort of negation we might choose in the long run - spiritual or physical. \\n Whether he saw himself as an 'ubermensch' is unclear. It is unlikely. He was a prophet of the new type like his Zarathustra, a man crying 'God is dead' in a world that thought him 'mad'. And so we come to his fundamental flaw. He rightly castigated 'compassion'. He was right to do so in two senses. First, as the psychic vampirism of the liberal or Christian or progressive with power in hand whose 'compassion' is a form of power relation, denying the rights of the victim to be anything other than a victim. Second, in the Buddhist sense, of a distanced 'compassion' for the world, a 'compassion' which is the negation of existence, a refusal to engage in life. \\n In his determination to call the tune on the 'slave mentality' and the life-negating aspects of these two types of compassion, which are really forms of self-centred victimisation of others and of oneself respectively, he hardened himself and he forgot a third form of compassion. There was no energy left for this compassion and no insight into the self to see its necessity. This is the third form of compassion, one that arises from the Will to Power where another or others becomes existentially chosen, without illusion, to become part of oneself yet with respect for their own autonomy. It is, in short, 'love'. Poor Nietzsche never seems to have had the chance to experience this sense of worlds entwined and of the interconnection between equals that goes far beyond the nonsense of modern romanticism. \\n In his one big blind spot, he did not understand just how much his Will to Power was bound up with the libido (where we are indebted to Freud in raising its presence as unconscious drive). This is the energy designed to acquire 'more' and make oneself whole - being social animals, this includes relations with others. All relations with others are relations of power but, at a certain point, we can decide ourselves whether they are relations of power that are inherited, especially inherited by our slavish internal needs created by society for society (as in Christian cultural repression), or they are relations of power that we create and in which our true nature is best expressed by having relations of power that are calibrated to be as equal as possible. Why? Because that is how we get our greatest pleasure, conversing within an aristocracy of equals (not materially but existentially). \\n By the time of his madness, Nietzsche will have been very isolated and lonely. There was no love in his life. No interconnection. Certainly no aristocracy of existential equals. Nor could he expect such an aristocracy to emerge in his life time - indeed, one may be emerging only now with new forms of communication. When he saw that horse beaten (I surmise), he saw not merely himself beaten but the raw misery of a world in which one man may speak the truth of what is to come and yet know that no-one will understand until he is long dead (if at all). Worse, by the doctrine of the eternal return, his life would be an eternal round of such existential lonelinesses. This does not negate his affirmation of life but his surge of compassion for that horse is a rising up of compassion for a humanity that does not 'get it' and for himself as the person who does and is before his time. \\n Given everything that had gone before, his only 'choice' is an assumed or actual madness. In a parody of the Christian message which he excoriated mercilessly, Nietzsche is 'crucified' on the cross of his own humanity.\"),\n",

       "  'I am well aware that James Robinson isn\\'t to every readers taste. That said, much of his style about which others complain are exactly the things I most love. He focuses on the basics of story telling -- character, setting, mood -- and never forgets that the excitement of action remains directly proportional to how much a reader cares about the characters. No where has he so demonstrated his gifts (and here fans of Golden Age may reasonably disagree) than on his magisterial Starman. \"The Shade\" gives readers the chance to revisit with some of Robinson\\'s finest characters -- not the least of which being the Opal City, which while he wasn\\'t the author to name, he was certainly the magician who brought it to life. \\n As with Starman, Robinson demonstrates in \"The Shade\" the extraordinary depth of his knowledge of the Golden Age. I\\'m pretty good on the topic, but even I found myself needing Google to locate Madam Fatal (a man who fought crime dressed as a woman! Who said that comics only turned mature recently?). And even Robinson\\'s newer characters, such as the Spanish crime fighting vampire La Sangre, possess a wonderful flare that kindles some light from the Golden Age. \\n Getting deep into the plot of the book would be giving too much away. Suffice to say that when Richard Swift (the Shade), a man alive for more than a century finds his past catching up with him, he must delve back into his own earlier days to solve the mystery. A rip-roaring great read! \\n A word about the artists of this book. I\\'m not usually a fan of multiple artist books, preferring the continuity of a single pen and brush. Yet if anything the array of artistic talent only adds to the books excellence. Each artist somehow finds his place in the story and makes the world his own. Gene Ha of Top 10 fame is as always excellent. Cooke captures a certain wonderful Golden Age sensibility. Hamner\\'s thick brush strokes bring The Shades shadow tendrils to life. \\n If you\\'re just starting in Robinson\\'s world, you\\'ll need a few pages to gain your footing and then love this book. Starman fans will find here the delight of a party where you get to again encounter friends too long absent. Either way, you\\'ll want to step into the Shade.'),\n",

       "  'There was much talk about the gender flip when Goddess Thor replaced Odinson (which was to be expected), and much of the initial talk came from Thor fans (mostly men) who were critical of the change. Then that talk was answered by the opposition camp (mostly women) who were critical of the criticism. \\n I have been a Marvel Thor fan since I was a teenager. I have the entire run of Walt Simonson bagged and boarded and filed for posterity, and I have a future tattoo of a Simonson Thor all picked out. My daughter loves Lady Sif (and hates Jane Foster because Jane gets in the way of Sif\\'s love), and her twin brother has won awards for his God of Thunder cosplay at local conventions. We are a Thor family, so I couldn\\'t help be interested in the debate. \\n I personally loved the idea as soon as I heard it was happening because I\\'d had my own idea for years that every character that Thor truly loved -- Sif, Jane, Baldur, Freyja, maybe even Steve -- were worthy of Mjolnir, and that any of them in a time of dire need could lift the hammer. My heart and brain were prepared for the change, therefore, and I had no problem seeing someone else wield Mjolnir, especially knowing it was coming from the very capable mind of Jason Aaron. \\n Surprise, surprise, though ... my twelve year old twins had other ideas. \\n I was fully expecting them to be on board and excited like I was, but neither of them were, which made me pause and want to take another, deeper look at why it is that some folks (those mostly men again) were so upset by the Thor shakeup. \\n I started by talking to my daughter. For Bronte it was annoyance at the gimmickieness of the whole thing. You see, Bronte already loves Asgard\\'s heroines. Her favourite, favourite, favourite Marvel Superhero is the Lady Sif (her very first comic was during the Sif arc of Journey Into Mystery), and Valkyrie was the next Asgardian she came to love, so she was annoyed that the creators must have thought that the only way to get girls to read Thor comics was to make Thor female rather than to start telling tales that foregrounded the amazing women that already exist in the Marvel Universe and give them their own titles. \\n She, it turns out, wants the already existing women of Marvel to achieve the level of respect they deserve and to, in her words, \"Not ride the coattails of the boys!\" \\n Then I went to my son. For Milos, the problem had to do with the loss of Thor \"him\"self. Milos imagines himself as Thor nearly every day and still, at twelve, pretends he\\'s Thor, running around the house in helmet and cape with Mjolnir in hand saving the realms. His blonde hair (turning brown slowly these days, much to his chagrin) is down to his shoulders and has only been cut (well... trimmed rather than cut) once a year for his whole life - all of this because of Thor. So he saw Lady Thor as an undermining of all he loved. Not only was Thor suddenly personally unworthy of his hammer, but someone else was worthy, and Milos felt like he couldn\\'t play her because she was, well, a her. The change hurt him, then the hurt became anger because he wondered why they couldn\\'t just make a new hero who was a girl and leave Thor alone. \\n I was surprised. I figured my own opinion would be theirs (not at all self-absorbed, am I?). But it wasn\\'t, and they were pissed in a place where I was excited. And neither of them fill the stereotype of what one might imagine the opponents of Lady Thor to be. Milos comes closer, certainly, but he lives in a home of strong women, and he is not a basement dwelling square, and all his best friends are girls, and he loves damn near every Marvel Superheroine there is. \\n But here\\'s the kicker. Once the two of them read Goddess of Thunder, one of them decided it was awesome and the other had their opinion that it sucked deepened. I imagine you\\'ve guessed it, but it is Bronte who hates it more and Milos who has decided Lady Thor is \"badass cool!\" \\n Bronte just can\\'t see the point. Lady Thor is just Thor (and by the time she finished Goddess of Thunder, she knew exactly who Lady Thor is), and Lady Sif barely gets any time at all, and besides, Bronte would just rather read stories about the awesome ladies that have always been there. \\n Milos, however, is super stoked because it\\'s not like Thor is gone. He has relinquished the name Thor and become Odinson (certainly nonsensical if you are a believer in Norse Religion, but fitting in the Marvel Universe), and even though he\\'s lost Mjolnir, he still has Jarnbjorn and a sweet new Uru arm. So there is a new-old Thor out there for him to play, and now that he knows who Lady Thor is and is able to put into the context of the overarching tale, he\\'s just fine. \\n You just never know why people are going to fear change or even hate change once it has happened, but something about this moment tells me we need to listen to peoples stories rather than shutting them up and shutting them down. And that goes for everyone. \\n For me, I love Thor, the Goddess of Thunder. She makes sense. It enriches her, the character who is now Thor, and it enriches Odinson, and I am a sucker for the enriching of stories and characters I love. I should get the next 5 issues soon. Can\\'t wait to give them a go'),\n",

       "  'I feel like reviewing each issue as I go, so take that, reader. \\n Fables: Chapter #1 -- \"Old Tales Revisited\":There are times when everything is stacked against a work. For me, that time comes most often when everyone and everything is telling me that I should and will adore the work in question. Fables is my case in point. It is a multi-award winning, literature based satire/allegory that multiple reviewers, whom I trust, and friends have recommended, but Fables cannot survive that weight (at least not in this first chapter). I finished \"Old Tales Revisited\" baffled by the fuss. I found it not at all original (I know, I know, how can it be when it is playing with fairy tales? But \"Fractured Fairy Tales\" from Bullwinkle and Rocky were original, so it is possible), not at all entertaining, and not at all worth my time. Thus, I will, of course, be continuing with the next issue right away (probably tonight).Fables: Chapter #2 -- \"The (Un)Usual Suspect\":So the investigation has begun and Bigby, the humanized Big Bad Wolf, is being fleshed out as a character. We see him hanging out with an embittered Pig of the Three Little Pigs fame, and we get some dumb jokes about \"ham & eggs,\" and that is precisely what this comic is shaping up to be so far: an excuse for dumb jokes and \"fabulist\" stupidity. It\\'s off-putting, and it constantly pushes me out of the world. What Willingham most needed was a strong editor to cut through the crap because the mystery of Rose Red\\'s murder (kidnapping?) could have been okay. Here\\'s the other thing ... why is it that when a mash-up occurs from one genre to another it is always a mash-up with Mystery? I\\'m guessing because it is easy. But wouldn\\'t it be more interesting, more unique, more worthy of praise to mash-Fables-up with something less used and abused? I think so. Finally, I am hating Snow White, and digging Prince Charming. Less of the former and more of the latter, please.Fables: Chapter #3 -- \"Blood Tells\":My real problem with this series is beginning to coalesce. It is not fully formed, and it could be overturned by future chapters, but my problem with Fables at the moment is that the modernized Fables aren\\'t working for me. I am sure Bill Willingham thinks it\\'s clever to put the Fables in the modern world, but why, I wonder, would the Fables have to fight their natures? Surely they could just be who they were in the past in the modern world, using the modern world to further their initial desires, to bring their fables and fairy tales into modernity. He flirts with that with one or two characters, but the bulk of the characters go against their nature, and it certainly seems that way with Bigby (the main character?) at the moment. Perhaps this has something to do with the Adversary, but I know nothing of him/her/it at the moment, and all I see are characters not staying true to their natures. It ain\\'t working for me.Fables: Chapter #4 -- \"Remembrance Day\":The segregation of the human (or passably human) and the inhuman in this book pisses me off. Not only does it have the stink of that old stand-by of fantasy -- racism -- about it, but it is also lazy story telling. It doesn\\'t have to be this way, and at this point not enough is being done to explain the segregation. All it does is raise questions for me. Why, for instance, must the Fables live in New York, or any big city for that matter? Why can\\'t the inuman Fables in the New York Zoo, or within a self-contained, wizard enclosed (you know, like Bluebeard\\'s castle in an apartmen), city positioned menagerie? No good answer for either of these questions, yet segregation is put forward as a necessity, and even the law. Is this intentional commentary? Or is this just something the author thought was clever without consideration of its potential subtext? I am leaning towards the latter. There\\'s one more chance for Willingham to capture me as an ongoing audience member, but I won\\'t be making any wagers in that direction.Fables: Chapter #5 -- \"The Famous Parlor Room Scene (Sans Parlor)\":I noticed this on the cover of my book last night before I read Chapter 5: \"[Fables is] a top-notch fantasy comic that is on par with Sandman.\" ~~Variety. I say, \"Fuck off!\" to that. That\\'s like saying My Little Pony is on par with Swamp Thing. Trust me. Variety is wrong (even if this series gets better).Fables: Supplemental #1 -- \"A Wolf in the Fold\":Perhaps there is more going on in Bill Willingham\\'s brain than what makes it into the first Fables arc (which doesn\\'t surprise me, but it may drive me further in the series). Included in this first volume is an origin story about the Wolf\\'s importance in the escape from the Adversary and his long term love for Snow White. It\\'s is much, much better than the graphic novel that preceded it, and I think if that had been the story proper I\\'d have loved the first shot of Fables rather than the annoyance I felt. Too bad this tale was only a background story. It\\'s better than the story Willingham chose to tell.Fables: Shameless Advertising #1 -- \"The Price of a Happy Ending\":It\\'s the first excerpt from another work in the greater Fables universe, wherein a fire breathing Raven talks a pair of Fables into some covert black ops in the war, black ops that will alleviate some of the necessary genoiced. It\\'s tantalizing, certainly more interesting in these few pages than the first arc of the series proper, but I think Chris\\'s statement in the comments is still a more compelling reason to continue.Fables: Shameless Advertisng #2 -- \"Animal Farm\":Hmmm ... this looks much more promising, and since it is the direct continuation of \"Legends in Exile\" I can actually see myself giving this a crack. I like that Willingham is addressing, to some extent, the disparity between the city dwellers and those on the farm. I am not sure that he is conscious of the racism yet, but I\\'ve a feeling he may be; if not conscious then it is depressingly present in a way that will kill the story for me entirely, but this bit of advertising may actually have worked for me.Fables: Shameless Advertising #3 -- \"Fairest\":So the ad for the comic focused on the Princesses begins with the Prince of Thieves sneaking through a camp of goblins to smoock a princess or two. Cool art. Don\\'t care.'),\n",

       "  'Thor Visionaries Volume One covers one of the greatest periods in Thor\\'s little corner of the Marvel Universe, issues #337-#348. I read them when they first came out, and they are all packed away in mylar bags and comic boxes in my office. I was pretty stoked to have them all in this Graphic Omnibus edition, and for the most part they didn\\'t disappoint. Here are my highs, mediums and lows. \\n Thor Visionaries: Top Ten -- The Awesomeness \\n 1. Balder the Brave - The best story arc of the Omnibus, we see Balder gone to seed after a horrible experience in Hel. He was killed by Loki, banished to Hel, and met all of those he had ever killed in battle while being tormented by demons. It leaves him a husk of a god, and once he is in the land of the living he avows pacifism. The path back to the sword, which is also, interestingly enough, his path back to vitality and life, is the one part of the twelve comics I most looked forward to. \\n 2. Lorelei - Super hotty, especially for a teenager who loved red heads. Even if she\\'s mere pencils and ink, she\\'s scorching. And I always kind of wanted Thor to stay under the spell of her love potion. \\n 3. Thor - Pretty cool for a big, violent dumb ass. Still don\\'t know how being big, dumb and tough makes you worthy to wield Mjolnir, but then I\\'m not Odin. \\n 4. Odin - I didn\\'t remember his omnipresence, but it was an excellent surprise. Odin was actually a pretty cool character, and I liked the way that he didn\\'t always serve as a deus ex machina. He was as vulnerable as the next god -- almost. \\n 5. The Clark Kent Cameo - Silly, and a whole lot of fun, especially with Lois giving him shit for his clumsiness. \\n 6. Reinforcement of Why I <3 Samuel L. Jackson - Of all the changes Mark Millar made to the Marvel Universe, specifically to the Avengers and SHIELD, turning Nick Fury into a bad-ass-Sam Jackson-clone, thus dropping his crusty and cliched WWII persona, was a stroke of genius. Nick Fury was lame back in my day. Today, he could righteously stand up and tell the Hulk to \"Go the Fuck to Sleep,\" and I bet the Hulk would listen. \\n 7. Multiple storylines - Simonson\\'s greatest storytelling strength was his ability to juggle multiple storylines without short changing any. He kept the pace cooking, kept us interested in everything, and had an eye for a long term story. For instance, the opening frames of #337 show the arms of Surtur forging his sword. We see him for twelve straight issues before that little storyline has come to fruition. It is present as prologue. And the last frames of the last comic we see? Surtur ready to kick ass. Very cool. \\n 8. Malekith - Bad ass villain. I even named a half-elf in D&D after him, although my wizard didn\\'t have the multi-toned skin of Malekith. \\n 9. Loved the Secret Wars panel - There\\'s this cool blank space left in #341 with three missing panels, which show the Avengers on the way to the Beyonder\\'s Secret War. You could cut out the panel from somewhere else and paste it in your comic. I bought extras at the time so I could do that (I know, I know). But they provide the real panels in the appendix here. Fun. \\n 10. Walt Simonson\\'s Art - There\\'s a sixties nostalgia to Simonson\\'s eighties art that always appealed to me. The goddesses, Sif and Lorelei, look like a pair of gorgeous, buxom movie stars, the sort Hitchcock would have cast in his films (nothing like the inhuman buxomness of the nineties), and there is an unfinished quality to his pencils that adds real texture to his section of the Marvel Universe. \\n Thor Visionaries: Middle Five -- The Blah-ness \\n 11. Beta Ray Bill - I remembered Beta Ray Bill with such fondness that when I saw him on the cover locked in combat with Thor, I just had to buy the graphic novel. Oh! what a difference twenty years make. The Ballad of Beta Ray Bill section of this omnibus was soooooo boring. I wanted to like it, but now I just feel a little stupid for ever having loved it. It was okay, I guess, but a bit much considering its primary purpose seemed to be getting Thor out of his mortal Dr. Donald Blake form. \\n 12. From Donald Blake to Sigurd Jarlson - Not sure this ever really needed to happen, but whatever ... Simonson got to make Thor look like a big Viking beefcake in a t-shirt and tight pants, so some wish fulfillment must have been at work. At least it led us to today and Chris Hemsworth in a t-shirt and tight pants in the film. Silver lining. \\n 13. Sif - She\\'s okay, but pretty damn fickle and pretty damn thick. But hey, she can overlook Beta Ray Bill\\'s ugliness, so that\\'s something. \\n 14. Superman Secret Identity Idiocy - So suddenly Thor is Sigurd. Nick Fury throws a pair of big geeky glasses on him, and Simonson instantly sees that the glasses hiding Thor are as stupid as the glasses hiding Superman, so he pokes fun at it by having a bunch of folks almost make the connection between the big blonde Norseman and Thor, but not quite (one guy figures Sigurd must be Spidey). Good on him for recognizing the idiocy, but it is handled pretty poorly. \\n 15. Surtur and Twilight - The presence of Surtur throughout is cool, but I was bummed when the last comic collected in this Omnibus culminated in Surtur\\'s escape from exile. That\\'s where I wanted to start, not finish. \\n Thor Visionaries: Bottom Eight -- The Crapness \\n 16. Not Enough Loki - Where was he? Sure he shows up once in a while to meddle, but he wasn\\'t nearly meddlesome enough, and apart from a little nudging of Lorelei in her quest for Thor\\'s love, Loki spent most of his time messing with Balder the Brave. \\n 17. Fafnir the Dragon - This jackass looks like a pugilistic Godzilla. \\n 18. Simonson\\'s Idiotic Time Keeping - The major downfall in Simonson\\'s storytelling is his inability to make time work. His narrative is all over the place when it comes to time. We see days pass in one thread and minutes pass in another, but they are presented as though they are simultaneous. It\\'s a minor complaint, really, because comics can be forgiven time lapses, but it pulled me out of the moment more than once. \\n 19. Fafnir the Dragon - Could this big Jurassic Park reject just shut the hell up?! \\n 20. Not Enough Warriors Three - Volstagg, Fandral and Hogun are too cool to be barely seen. But there was less of them than Loki. \\n 21. Fafnir the Dragon - So Fafnir is out destroying the poor areas of New York, and he\\'s yelling for Thor (who is off in Antarctica), and the television news crews are wondering where Thor is, and I\\'m wondering where the hell everyone else is? Where\\'s Spidey? The rest of the Avengers? Daredevil? Fantastic Four? Even Sub-Mariner? Silliness. \\n 22. Fafnir the Dragon - Did I mention this dragon sucked? \\n 23. Fafnir the Dragon - Oh yeah, and Fafnir the Dragon. Lamest Thor villain ever!'),\n",

       "  \"This has to be the darkest Batman book I've ever read. It was interesting to read this as I am sure it had a huge inspiration for the Arkham Asylum games (this is MUCH older). The artwork in this is really what stands out to me. It is so incredibly dark and mysterious. It looks like something out of 1990s grunge horror aesthetic, like for a Nine Inch Nails or Marylin Manson album. It is a mix of altered photography, painting, mixed media and a number of different things. It's weird and cool and horrifying. And REALLY hard to parse. Batman is hardly visible at any time, which kinda sorta makes sense, since it's Batman, he works in the shadows and all that. But it makes it difficult for a story. It's interesting to read Morrison's script and notes in the back of this collectors book. I personally think this would have been a far better book with a different artist. Also, the artist for this, Dave McKean, is a bit of an elitist. The notes in the back say how Morrison wanted to include Robin as well, but McKean put his foot down and said something to the effect of him barely being able to stoop so low as an Artist to draw Batman and he's definitely not doing the Boy Wonder. That alone kind of makes me hate him. The blurry depictions are another. BUT, his Joker is freaky as hell and fantastic. His alternative depictions, based on Morrison's direction, of some of the other characters are interesting. Zeus, in particular. His head was connected by wires to electronics. Clayface I had no idea was Clayface until I read the script, so I don't know that that was a success. It made him more of a putrescent tiny thing. Croc was done well. There were a couple others. \\n Now, for the story. It was, well, it was confusing. Overall, it was good. Behind the scenes, it was superb. There is so much symbolism by Morrison that you can't go two panels without tripping over it. The problem was, more than half the time you can't see it due to the art. (why i think it would be a better book with a better different artist) On the surface it was a story of Batman coming to his personal demons and blasting through that and becoming a stronger hero. This is parallel to the story of Amadeus Arkham falling into madness and building his asylum. Skimming the script in the back (after the comic proper) and reading the subscript notes, you realize he had stuff that alluded to religion and architecture and classic archetypes and hag/mother/virgin and on and on and on. But the problem is, A) I couldn't see most of that and B) symbolism only works when it's fairly common. Some of that would have been fine, but some of it was incredibly obscure stuff. Off the top of my head, I can't recall if I've read anything by Morrison before, but he mentions a lot of these themes are common to his work. Maybe he is working through some of his issues himself. I'm not going to now, with this first reading, but I'd like to buy this book (I got it from the library) and tackle it a little slower, reading the script at the same time as the artistic version and really delve into it. Then I can determine how much is really just in Morrison's head and how much actually came through in the book. I kind of think it will be a lot of the former. \\n The lettering is another thing to mention. While Batman's bubbles are white on black and are generally easy enough to read, some of the other characters are difficult. Amadeus was usually fine, black on white but his letters are squiggly and sometimes not easy to read. A lot of the other characters were okay. Joker, on the other hand, I really had to squint with the paper close. They were red on whatever background (generally very dark, but sometimes not flat colored), the letters were chaotic, and the lines were not straight, and sometimes they even included splatter effects. It was a chore to read his lines and sometimes I wasn't even sure if I read them right. It fit the character well enough, but I should not have to try so hard to read a comic, no matter how dark and brooding this book is. \\n One thing I want to point out - The Hieronymus Bosch homage as Arkham Asylum was opened/revealed - that was an awesome touch.\"),\n",

       "  'I\\'m mini-reviewing each issue as I go again. Hope you don\\'t mind. feel like reviewing each issue as I go, so here goes. \\n Avengers Academy #14 -- \"Disaster Response\": The Academy is falling apart, it seems, and the kids , desirous to show off their preparedness, cajole their teachers -- Giant Man (Hank Pym) and Tigra -- into sending them into an active situation to take on Electro, who is running amok in a French labratory. It\\'s a trap, however, and the whole Sinister Six, including the ever \"superior\" Doc Oc, are up to no good. The wee-Avengers get their asses handed to them, the Sinister Six escape, and as usual, Hank -- the angstiest of all Marvel characters -- blames himself. \\n There is a nice moment when the Avengers get booted from France and Headmaster Pym takes heat for sending baby Avengers instead of the real thing to deal with the situation, but there was little else of interest here. \\n This issue feels like filler before something real happens, but those issues aren\\'t always poor. Sometimes they are the best issues in a run. Here, though, apart from the Sinister Six, this issues is just plain lame. \\n Avengers Academy #14.1 -- \"Peer Pressure\": Good lord! The exposition and recapping was awful at the beginning of this issue. Thank the comic gods for the introduction of recap pages. Anyway, our wee-Avengers are still stuck on the idea that they\\'re only provisional Avengers to keep them from becoming super-villains, so they decide to seek out others of their generation who were tortured and experimented on by Norman Osborne when he was in charge of S.H.I.E.L.D.. And finally ... FINALLY ... they have their own villain as a result of their nose-poking: billionaire, genius Jason Briggs, who also happens to be able to control and morph every chemical in existence. He wants to change the world, but first he wants to recruit the wee-Avengers to his cause. It could be the beginning of a beautiful antagonism. \\n Avengers Academy #15 -- \"No Unwounded Soldiers\": The shit hits the Raft, and the super-villains are loose in the world. Everyone is busy. Every Avenger is at work rounding up super-felons, so the Avengers Academy is once again activated and sent in to the fight. They go up against Sin, the Red Skull\\'s daughter, and her minions in Washington DC. It seems that many of the villains, Sin included, are wielding hammers with Asgardian power levels, making them psychotic versions of Thor. This may be one of the stupidest events Marvel has ever produced. I avoided Fear Itself when it was first release -- all of it -- and it seems I had the right idea back then. It is a load of crap. \\n In Avengers Academy news, Mettle kills someone for the first time, and Tigra teaches him that feeling bad about killing is good enough to atone for the sin because it makes you better than the \"bad guy\" who certainly wouldn\\'t feel the same way and because he started the fight, so ... yeah. There is that. \\n Avengers Academy #16 -- \"A God-Awful Small Affair\": This should really be called \"Two God-Awful Small Affairs\" because it is really two mini-stories mashed into one. \\n The first story is just a fist fight between the juiced up and hammer carrying villains Titania and the Absorbing Man and Hank Pym. Pym is hopelessly out muscled, but he is a smarty pants and wins a tentative victory. It basically sucks. \\n The second story is much more interesting. Veil, the girl who can take the shape of any gas and who will one day dissipate into nothingness, is doing damage control. She saves a little girl from a crumbling building, then goes into the rubble to find the girl\\'s mother. She saves the mother, reunites mother and daughter, then can only watch as one of Sin\\'s minions shoots the mother in the back, right before the daughter\\'s eyes. Veil, the nicest of all the wee-Avengers, loses control, turns into a poisonous vapour and kills the body armour clad killer. I am looking forward to seeing what this does to little Maddy Berry. I am liking her more and more. She must be about to die soon. No one I love hangs around. \\n Avengers Academy #17 -- \"Battle Scars\": For an issue title \"Battle Scars\" there is very little dealing with said scars. We have Mettle feeling bad about killing, Veil deciding that her killing was righteous and telling Mettle to suck it up, and that is it. The rest of the comic is the juiced up Absorbing Man and Titania invading Hank Pym\\'s Infinite Avengers Mansion. The lameness of the tale is taking its toll on these characters, and a death in the ranks is much needed, just to change up the dynamic. If not for my love of Avengers Arena, and my commitment to know these characters better, I would have stopped reading this before I ever reached this issue. The Fear Itself stuff is making this insufferable. \\n Avengers Academy #18 -- \"Bad Guys\": The battle in the Infinite Avengers Mansion, in the Underverse beneath the Microverse beneath our Universe, Titania and Absorbing Man continue to \"scare\" the weeVengers so they can relish the fear they\\'re giving off. There\\'s a little talk from Striker about he and Hazmat and Finesse -- the three \"darkest\" baby Avengers -- should bad guy it up and start acting like \"Dr. Doom,\" but all that talk was a tease, and they end up doing the smartly heroic thing and trick Titania and Crusher Creel into smacking each other with their goofy hammers. It doesn\\'t work, but it was heroic. \\n There is something fun about this arc that hovers beneath the surface, and that is the way the Pym Particles are being used throughout. They are one of the most fascinating bits of comic science, and Christos Gage actually puts them to good use, especially when he uses them to backfire on the Academy. \\n Avengers Academy #19 -- \"Things Fall Apart\": Aaaah ... the classic someone-has-to-sacrifice-themself moment with the nobody-needs-to-be-sacrificed-after-all intervention. Still, the interaction between Finesse and her fellows, Mettle\\'s defence of Hazmat, Hazmat\\'s decision to smooch in the face of danger, and that thing with Veil where she quits the team because the \"sick\" Avengers have trained these kids to kill and even embrace suicide made this the best chapter of the arc. \\n With only one issue to go in the Avengers Academy portion of Fear Itself, I can safely say that this portion of this event sucks. \\n Avengers Academy #20 -- \"Endings\": Now that the Fear Itself crap is over, Avengers Academy is finally back on track a bit. This aptly named chapter winds up Veil\\'s story quite nicely, and we have a couple of long overdue departures to celebrate: Speedball and Justice (two of the lamest Avengers ever conceived) decide to stop teaching at the Academy and go on a road trip to see America. Comedy. Plus, the potential villainy of Jeremy Briggs continues to grow in its creepy, Lex Luthor way (yeah, I know. It\\'s a DC metaphor. Sue me). \\n And then it ends on a note that makes me happy in the most nostalgic of ways: without the Infinite Avengers Mansion the Academy needs to set up a new shop, so they choose the West Coast Avengers mansion. Oh how I loved the West Coast Avengers. It\\'s time to look at those comics again.'),\n",

       "  'Captain Atom #1It has been so long anything with Captain Atom that I can\\'t even remember his real name, and they helped me not a whit in this opening issue. No matter, they told us what we needed to know about him: 1. he\\'s an ex-pilot; 2. he had a quantum accident during a mission he volunteered for that made him into Captain Atom; 3. he absorbs energy; 4. he can manipulate matter, organic or inorganic, at at least the atomic level, including himself; 5. he could on the verge of dissipating as he tries to bring his powers under control; 6. he\\'s in some study under Dr. Megala -- a sort of Stephen Hawking for the DC universe; 7. his own safety means less than the safety of people he doesn\\'t know; 8. So he\\'s a hero. \\n I don\\'t know what to expect and my memory\\'s not helping me out, so I will just enjoy this without access to my suppressed biases. \\n Now for the technical side. Two things jumped out at me: 1. the colouring of Jose Villarrubia is beautiful stuff. 2. For some reason I love the \"comuterised\"dialogue boxes of Dr. Megala. They\\'re unique and oddly endearing. There. I said it.Captain Atom #2Second issue in a row where Captain Atom\\'s conflict is a problem that needs to be and can be fixed without engaging in battle. last time he absorbed the energy of a NYC volcano, and this time he goes into a kid\\'s head (quite literally) to \"attack\" and eradicate the boy\\'s brain tumour. That and the struggle to stay corporeal are the conflicts in the story. There are no big villains, no scenes of Captain Atom punching the shit out of people or attacking them with radioactive bolts, just a super-guy solving problems as peaceably as he can, which is more peaceably than anyone else I\\'ve seen. It will probably change (there is a mutated beast at the end of issues #1 & #2 that suggest there\\'s a big traditional battle coming) but this intelligent use of his powers is refreshing while it lasts. \\n I aldo want to mention a wonderful moment, which is, perhaps, my favourite moment in a New 52 opening arc -- Captain Atom bombarded my communication. He is being discussed by his colleagues at the lab, and not in the friendliest of terms, but he is oblivious to them because his brain is tuned into all electronic communication that\\'s floating through the air. It overwhelms him and he tries to process it all at once. The art supporting the moment is as perfect as the moment itself. Well worth a read just for this, I think.Captain Atom #3Captain Atom is starting to feel like a god. Nothing seems to be beyond him. He needn\\'t eat or sleep, so he needn\\'t stop saving lives, which takes him into the metaphysical questions only he, the Beyonder or Dr. Manhattan (and maybe a couple of others) need to ponder: Am I a God? Am I God? Does my presence disrupt God\\'s plan? \\n These are excellent questions for a guy who can absorb a nuclear blast and who scares the hell out of the Justice League and Flash to try and answer for himself. The answers, though, aren\\'t easy, and I can\\'t see them becoming easier as this arc proceeds.Captain Atom #4Now the question is: Am I a weapon? The answer to this one is obvious, though, so Captain Atom must decide if he is willing to be a deterant in the \"good ol\\' U.S. of A.\\'s\" arsenal. It takes no time for him to make the choice, and once again, despite half the air force attacking him with missiles and bullets, he doesn\\'t take the bellicose route. He transmutes the armaments into feathers, mooting their offensive capacity, proving his place as one of the coolest heroes around. \\n Meanwhile, the title itself feels like it is about to take a turn into 50s Sci-Fi cheesiness, which could be glorious if handled well. Bring on the mutated bio-goo of any shape and swelling size!Captain Atom #5Twice in this issue, Captain Atom engages in classic super-heroing: the first is in a dream and leads to the disintegration of Dr. Renata Carter, one of the scientists studying him (and the one who seems to be falling in love with him), so he chooses a less destructive path when he actually goes to help Renata, taking a decidely less super-heroey path in the end; the second is in reality, and the flesh mutation beast that has been growing at the end of each comic has eaten (devoured? absorbed?) the population of an entire town, and Captain Atom loses his temper, lashing out with his energy in a very super-heroey way, but it doesn\\'t work the way he planned, and the fleshy mutation beast grows exponentially. Then it begins -- possibly -- to devour Captain Atom himself. The super-heroey stuff has backfired. Sweet! \\n I want more of the non-super-heroey stuff. It\\'s refreshing beyond belief.Captain Atom #6Freddie Williams II\\'s art is damn good, but it is Jose Villarrubia\\'s colours that are the true star of this book. In fact, it is the colours that are pivotal to the books art. Villarrubia\\'s colours, the bright pastel of Captain Atom contrasted with the more naturally coloured real world, are some of the best I have ever seen, which is fitting considering how radical the tale is. \\n Captain Atom is a tale about what\\'s wrong with us, what\\'s right with us, and offers a message concerning where we should be and how we could get there if we would only try. Captain Atom is the best hero book I\\'ve read in quite some time. Thanks for your awesome writing, JT Krul. Well done indeed. \\n Sure Batman & Superman are good, but those books detract from DC\\'s other characters, who could be so much better than the headliners given half a chance -- and Krul proves that point right here in this book. I would love to see a world where Bats and Supes were rested indefinitely. Never going to happen, but it\\'s something pleasant to dream about.'),\n",

       "  \"A wonderful collection of truly spine tingling horror stories. Come take a walk in the woods and see what awaits you there... \\n My first experience with Emily Carroll's work was through the game The Yawhg. I love that game, and the visuals are aesthetically wonderful. When I spotted Through the Woods in a bookshop a couple of years later I recognised the artwork as being from the same artist and snapped it up quickly. This was a bloody marvelous choice on my part I must say. This book, is great. \\n I was reminded about this book when I saw it in Danielle's (The Introverted Book Nerd) post Trick or Treat Round the Block Book Tag and decided I must give it another read. Today is Halloween/Samhain so it was the perfect time. \\n In this book there are 5 short horror stories bookended by a short introduction and conclusion. My brief summary and thoughts on each story: \\n Our Neighbor's House - Three sisters are left alone by their father who tells them that if he doesn't return after three days, to go to the neighbour's house. He doesn't return. Instead, what does come to visit the girls isn't good. 4.428626 stars. I particularly loved the atmosphere created in this. \\n A Lady's Hands Are Cold - An aristocratic father arranges the marriage of his daughter to a man. The girl moves in with her bride to his lovely wide, white manor. Shortly after arriving, the girl discovers there are secrets within the house. Secrets that once discovered put her in peril. 3.265342637 stars. \\n His Face All Red - A man kills his brother. Seems reasonable. Problem is, it's the week after the event, and now his brother sits in the tavern laughing, drinking and celebrating with his fellow patrons.The murderous brother can not say anything. No longer able to sleep, he must travel to the spot where he left the body to discover what has happened. 5.2768437 stars! Oh boy, this story is full of the mega spoops! \\n My Friend Janna - Janna cons people by pretending to be able to speak to the dead. Her friend, Yvonne, hides in the walls of the house to make noises and convince people that Janna's readings are true. Janna and Yvonne find this whole situation amusing. One day, Yvonne starts to see a spirit haunting Janna. Janna changes. She becomes introverted, antisocial and short tempered. She spends all day writing nonsense in a notebook. Other spooky stuff happens but I don't want to spoil anything. 5.732623 stars! By far my favourite story in this collection. Is this a story about a woman being haunted by a ghost, or is it a clever metaphor for the impact depression can cause once it infects a life? I guess that is up for the reader to decide. \\n The Nesting Place - The only story in the collection that is set in a later time period (probably ~1950s, whereas the others feel more 1700-1800s). Bell goes to stay with her brother and his new fiance (Rebecca) for the summer in their house in the country. She is told a story by the housekeeper of how Rebecca once got lost in the woods and had fallen down a cave where she was stuck for 3 days. The housekeeper tells Bell this to ensure she doesn't go wandering in the woods alone. One day, Bell goes wandering in the woods alone. What she finds there... is just a bunch of butterflies and bluebells. Streams gently running their path. Birds singing in the trees. It's beautiful. Ha! I tricked ya. What a kneeslapper! It actually wasn't nice things she found there, it was very not nice things. 3.26767 stars. This was probably my least favourite of the bunch, but still a solid 3 star story. I still enjoyed it very much. It's a little less psychological than the others which is probably why it didn't spook me out as much. \\n Those scores above would give an average of 4.3942210674 stars overall. I'm giving an additional 0.5 stars for the introduction and conclusion and then ignoring all of that and scoring this 5.776659 stars. \\n For many of these stories the horror comes from that which we don't see. In Neighbor, Face, and Janna much of the horror takes place off page. None of the stories give a nice tied off ending, they are all a little open ended. If you have read my other horror book reviews you know that monsters, jump scares and gore just doesn't really do it for me. But those stories that plant the seeds of horrors that can take place in our mind just freak me the fuck out. Our own minds are by far the most scariest thing in life. These stories all feel intimate, exploring the vulnerability of characters and the scariness of change. \\n The artwork throughout is exceptional. I've become a fan of Emily Carroll's style. This is a quick read. On both read throughs I found myself consciously deciding to slow down a little and allowing myself to become completely engrossed in the setting. This is a thrilling collection of stories that seep into your mind and give you the chills for the rest of the day. I love it. \\n Check out this review on my blog - Random Melon Reads | Be my friend and chat with me on the twitter dot com \\n Anyway, I'm off to go exploring in the woods. There's a cave nearby that I keep meaning to check out. Peace and Love.\"),\n",

       "  'The first comic I ever bought was a Prince Namor. I was at the convenience store, long before I became a true comic collector, and found a beaten up Namor comic that captured my imagination, making me, forever, a fan of Namor no matter where or when he appears. \\n I haven\\'t read this sequence of Namor before, coming as it did after my retirment from comics, but now that I am exploring everything I missed, now that I am out of \"retirement\" as a collector, now that my son and I are geeking out on a regular basis, I couldn\\'t possibly pass up a collection of John Byrne (my nostalgic favourite) scripted and penciled Namors. \\n Namor, The Sub-Mariner #1 -- \"Purpose!\" This is not an auspicious start to a series. It may actually be the single worst number one I have ever read. It uses two separate epilogues and two separate prologues to deliver the clunkiest and least helpful exposition possible, moving us from classicly mercurial Namor to a kinder, gentler, Namor, who has been suffering from oxygen imbalances throughout his life due to his mixed Atlantean and Human heritage, to a forward thinking Namor, who decides to pursue his \"purpose\" -- currently undisclosed -- through capitalism, to his Namor\\'s future nemesis, the crazed, sixth richest man in the world, Desmond Marrs. It does, however, still contain John Byrne\\'s killer illustrations, and I find myself very excited to see where all of this poor storytelling is taking us. Strange. \\n Namor, The Sub-Mariner #2 -- \"Eagle\\'s Wing and Lion\\'s Claw\" Not great but better than the opening issue. This one pits Namor against the Griffin in a battle in the air and water around the Statue of Liberty. Carrie Alexander is the damsel in distress, her Dad was frightened into a coronary by the, Griffin, Namorita, Namor\\'s cousin, is back (quite unceremoniously), Headhunter is taking an interest in the half-naked, wing ankled guy streaking around the New York skyline, and the Marrs\\' twins are the antagonists at the action\\'s heart. Does any of this matter? Not really. All that matters is that Byrne is busy doing what he does -- action. All that matters here is the fight, and it\\'s a doozy that ends in a cliffhanger .... \\n Namor, The Sub-Mariner #3 -- \"Meeting of the Board\" ... But it wasn\\'t much of a cliffhanger because there was no way Namor was going to lose a fight against the Griffin. Instead, Namor turns the Griffin into his flying steed, breaking him in one of the most ridiculous and oddly perfect bronco busting scenes I\\'ve ever witnessed, and then he flies his steed to Roxxon, the oil giant he mistakenly (?) blames for the Griffin\\'s attack. He leaves the superbaddy with them, and flies off in a Namor-lite huff. His arrogance is beginning to peak out, but is it only blood poisoning or his natural state? I suppose only time will tell. And in case you\\'re wondering, Caleb Alexander is okay for now. His heart is stable. Just don\\'t get him excited. \\n Namor, The Sub-Mariner #4 -- \"Black Water\" The plot thickens until Namor finds himself trapped and suffocating in an oil spill, but none of that is important. What is important to me is a an occurrence of about six frames midway through the issue: Namor lounges in his salt water pool, talking to Namorita, then he sinks into the pool, drifting through bubbles, submerging himself. The conversation continues, though, because Namorita just pops her head beneath the water and keeps on chatting. This moment exemplifies what is great about John Byrne. More than any other comic creator of his generation, Byrne\\'s imagination extended to the mundane and morphed the mundane into something exceptional. His artwork in this moment is gorgeous, actually conveying the feeling of specific gravity in water, conveying drift, and Glynis Oliver\\'s colours gloriously match his pencils. His storytelling never reaches the level of the greats like Alan Moore or Chris Claremont, but damn can he do the little things well. \\n Namor, The Sub-Mariner #5 -- \"All the Rivers Burning\" The big oil spill is ablaze after an eco-Terrorist suicide bombs the slick. Iron Man wastes his time chasing a drone sent out as a diversion. Mr. Fantastic and the Invisible Girl try to contain the spill. Sub-Mariner swims off to an underwater lava vent, bringing back some thermal-eating, giant manta rays, and the day is saved (mostly through the efforts of Namor) even though the heroes do nothing in concert. There is part of me that thinks the disjointed (pseudo-)heroics of the four super beings is something to be appreciated, and I suppose I do, but it is overshadowed by the disjointedness of the story itself. I can\\'t \\n get a handle on anything that Byrne is doing, apart from the overdetermined eco-critcism he\\'s beating me over the head with. Subtle it is not. In other news, Namor is arrested as soon as the day is saved. Not sure why yet, but it\\'s probably due to his uninvited visit to the Roxxon board. \\n Namor, The Sub-Mariner #6 -- \"Out of Sight, Out of Mind.\" The shine of Byrne\\'s art (though there is a super cute drawing of Namorita at one point. One point in how many frames? Too many) has warn off, and all I can muster for this issue is a yawn. The Marrs plot is coming to fruition. Namor has decided to shift his affections from the uninterested Carrie to the very interested Phoebe (although she\\'s only interested as a ruse). Yawn. Scratch, scratch, scratch. And then there is a new villain, the embodiement of humanities offshore garbage dumping. It is a rot creature named Sluj(who happens to look an awful lot like the Swamp Thing). Snort. Sorry, my head bobbed there. I was resting me eyes. \\n Namor, The Sub-Mariner #7 -- \"... That I Be Shunned by All...\" Where the hell is Mothra when you need it? Not in New York fighting Sluj, that\\'s for sure. That\\'s up to Namor who just happens to hear about a giant beast in the ocean. He just happens to find the monster with no difficulty, then pops into the monster for a swim around, finds a shipload of passengers in a series of digestive cocoons and pulls a pretty girl in a bikini to safety to find out what happened, and he just happens to land -- amidst a thronging crowd -- right beside the scientist responsible for the monster, who just happens to have the antidote, and Namor just happens to be the perfect delivery system, and I just happened to stay awake long enough to see Headhunter swing by the Marrs Penthouse to collect a head. I suppose I will just happen to read the next issue soon too. \\n Namor, The Sub-Mariner #8 -- \"Never Bet the Devil Your Head\" We have here our first cusp issue where old storylines are closing out (so very unsatisfactorily) and new storylines are starting (some out of time Nazi baddies. Hooray!). At the moment Namor can\\'t fly, a residual effect from his defeat of Sluj, so he\\'s being driven around in the Marrs limousine (where it seems he shags Phoebe Marrs, or so we\\'re led to believe), then winds up in a room of heads. Ten or twelve heads. Human heads. Mounted on the wall like a wild animal trophy room. Apparently the lovely Headhunter collects the heads of New York\\'s best and brightest business men (and, yep, no one seems to have missed them), and her most recent addition is Desmond Marrs. Next up: Namor. So she pulls off her glasses, rolls her hypnotic eyes, and we\\'re off to the next issue. \\n Namor, The Sub-Mariner #9 -- \"Skull Orchard\" Thank Poseidon it is over! Blah, blah, blah, the Headhunter never cut off any heads. She simply kept the men alive with their heads poking through the wall, sometimes for years. Yeah, that\\'s believable (what the hell do you mean? It\\'s a comic book, dumb ass. Yeah, I know. But still ....). Some other stuff happens too. So I am finished. I am relieved. I am disappointed. I\\'ll probably read the next one, and I\\'ll complain about that one too, knowing full well what I am getting myself into.'),\n",

       "  'These Epic Collections have been very well designed, with good maps of the characters\\' adventures, and so this first Black Panther volume begins with the Panther\\'s first appearance in Fantastic Four #52-53. Mind you, the story isn\\'t that great; it begins with a typical superheroes-fight encounter and is filled with horrible dialogue and disbelievable plot points. But it also features the Panther\\'s origin, with Klaw and his mercs, and that\\'s very nicely presented. \\n \"Panther\\'s Rage\" (BP #6-18) fills the majority of this volume. One reviewer calls it the first graphic novel, though I suspect that\\'s a really hard to distinction to make. However, there\\'s no doubt that it\\'s a relatively coherent story with an overarching plot that ran for just more than two years(!). That\\'d be notable now, and was surely unheard of at the time. \\n The start of \"Rage\" is good but not great. The metaplot mostly consists of villains of the week, as a number of Killmonger\\'s associates bedevil Panther over the months -- some of whom return in Black Panther by Christopher Priest: The Complete Collection, Vol. 2, showing the influence of volume. However that plotting improves toward the end as a trip to Serpent Valley and what comes after begin to weave a very dense story. And even the stories about fighting villains are quite unlike what you\\'d find in your typical super stories at the time. It\\'s full of deep characterization, real \"life\", and a vivid view of Africa. \\n This is to say nothing of the art which is phenomenal as well. It\\'s not the drawing, which is all good quality, but rarely exceptional. It\\'s the layout which breaks borders, makes interesting use of panels, and creates dynamic full-page or double-page spreads. It reminds me of the early Infinity Inc. or Batwoman, and it\\'s another thing that was totally unknown at the time. That it appeared across so many artists suggests to me that McGregor must have been sketching out page designs for them. \\n Overall, \"Panther\\'s Rage\" is definitely groundbreaking and enthralling. Its only deficit is that it gets so dense at times that you have to set it aside to return to later. \\n \"The Panther vs. The Klan\" (BP #19-22, 24) is clearly an attempt to repeat the successful formula, but it\\'s not nearly as good. Oh, I\\'m certain the decision to actually depict a villainous klan was very gutsy (and commendable) on Marvel\\'s part, but the stories starts off with some pretty meaningless bashes against men in a variety of sheets. It only picks up toward the end when McGregor starts to investigate the history of the klan and to better delve into the mystery of Monica\\'s sister\\'s death. It may well have been on the same upward arc as McGregor\\'s first story, but sadly, this story wasn\\'t finished. (I\\'ve read that it later finished up with a different author at the end of the Black Panther v1). \\n I\\'ve based this rating primarily on the superb Panther\\'s Rage arc. The Klan storyline would be about 3.5 stars and the FF intro about 2.5 stars.'),\n",

       "  'Issue #1 -- Batman and Robin begins, and we get our first New 52 taste of the latest (fifth) Robin -- Damian Wayne (this time the son of Bruce Wayne and Talia al Ghul) -- in action with his father. It\\'s the first issue of the title in the New 52 relaunch, so there is some vague subplot leading to something big for the title\\'s future, but this is mostly a character piece wherein Bruce tries to exorcise the demons of his parents\\' murder in a moment of potential bonding with his cold, calculating, socio/psychopathic son, who was trained into his potent fighting skills by his mother\\'s League of Assassins. Damian is acerbic, has little patience, and is actually a welcome foil to Batman\\'s grim obsessions. While he\\'s a bit of a dick, he\\'s no Dick, but then who is?Issue #2 --The father-son story dominates the stage, and Bruce is found wanting, at the moment Damian is found in need. The former is cold, distant and imposing while the latter is arrogant, embittered, and rebellious. All of these facets, in both the Waynes, contribute to a sequence I have much difficulty with, which occurs after Batman & Robin do battle with some arms dealers: Damian being praised for checking his brutality. Is there really a level of violence that we should be okay with? Are we really supposed to be okay with Batman being a guide for what is appropriate violence? I am genuinely unsure of Tomasi\\'s intentions, but the blitheness with which this moment is handled unsettles me. I can\\'t help thinking that violence should be avoided entirely, then instantly jumping to the thought that if it is to be used as a primary tool then anything non-lethal -- even when brutal -- goes. I don\\'t know, but I wish the book would tackle this issue rather than simply taking Batman\\'s position tacitly.Issue #3-- The most compelling character in this arc is Damian Wayne. His precociousness, his intensity, his belief in his own righteousness make him instantly complicated -- though not yet complex -- and there is hope for growth in his short, brutal life. Damian\\'s primary purpose -- as with all Robins -- is to tell us about Bruce Wayne, and Damian is doing that, but, like Dick Grayson, there is a life worth caring about in Damian even beyond his father. While Bruce tries to \"correct\" and \"fix\" Damian\\'s League of Assassins\\' training, Bruce is actually imposing more problems, and as we can see on the sixth panel on the page where Damian leaves the Batcave, Alfred is aware of the damage that is being done. Lucky for our young Robin, one of his mentors sees what is going on. Batman is failing with his son; I hope Alfred can succeed.Issue #4 --Damian: \"You want me to be honest with you all the time, but you get to pick and choose when you want to be.\" \\n Bruce: \"I don\\'t expect you to understand this, but as a father there are some things I ...\" \\n Damian: \"Have to lie about?\" \\n Bruce: \"Can\\'t discuss with you. There\\'s a difference.\" \\n Bullshit, Bruce. You\\'re a hypocrite and a liar, and Damian is absolutely correct. Just ask Alfred.Issue #5 --Batman draws his ethical line here: he won\\'t kill people, at least not directly. \\n He will surveille anyone and everyone, illegally tapping into every security camera in Gotham. \\n He will unlawfully restrain adversaries, suspending them many feet over concrete or asphalt or water or rock, and this is often done as a tactic in interrogation. \\n He will unlawfully enter private property and beat the deinizens therein, knocking out multiple victims (which requires concussive force), then coerce and even torture others into divulging information. \\n He will assault anyone, moreover, who has even a smidgen of information he needs regardless of their whereabouts. \\n He will smash parked cars with his Batmobile, which have nothing to do with any crime, without any care about property damage or civilians who could be hurt in other ways. \\n But he won\\'t kill. So there is that.Issue #6 --Blood is thicker and all that. So Damian is willing to go the distance for Bruce, as I knew he would be, yet I can\\'t help feeling disappointed. I dig this arc, but I think that we needed a longer build to Damian\\'s loyalty. I don\\'t by the blood tie being strong enough. Not this soon. Still, this issue gave us the best taste of NoBody, which made for some exciting reading/viewing.Issue #7 --It\\'s the biggest battle in the title so far, and Batman comes oh so close to crossing his self-imposed line. He doesn\\'t, but someone else does -- and with aplomb. Issue #8 --The fighting is over and the healing, of a sort, can begin. It is a healing that contains an ethical dilemma that goes totally unaddressed by Peter J. Tomasi, and I get the impression that Tomasi doesn\\'t see it as an ethical dilemma at all. He seems to see ethics in the blackest of blacks and whitest of whites with the shades of grey acting as momentary lapses outside of the dominant shade rather than a position all its own. Grey is fleeting in this book. Black and white are permanent. Bruce is white. NoBody is black. And right now Damian is grey, but not for long. Which shade will our Robin turn out to be? I\\'d be happier if I thought there was any hope that Tomasi would leave him grey, but that\\'s never going to happen.This is a good book, and Damian is great, but it could have been even better with a little more thought put into consequences. Still, this is definitely worth a read. One of the best relaunches in the New 52.'),\n",

       "  \"see full review @ Katie's Corner \\n I think this particular manga has been on my to-read list for at least half a year. Somehow, I always found other things to read or just plainly ignored it. And now for some reason, it is the very first one to be reviews on my blog. Fate? I don't know about that. But as soon as I took up this manga the first 22 chapters went so fast I couldn't believe myself, and then I was waiting for about 2 weeks for the next chapter to be translated. Now I have to wait for even more... \\n First let's talk a bit about the plot. I think the summary doesn't give us a lot, but at the same time it intrigues enough to start reading. Let's say we have three main characters: Nino, Momo and Yuzu (Nino is a girl and Momo and Yuzu are guys). Nino and Momo are childhood friends, who are very, very fond of each other. They are always together doing stuff and especially sing different songs. Because of some circumstances Momo's family has to move away and those two promise each other that their singing will be the sign to bring them together in the future. \\n Now, you'll think total childhood friendship cliche. Well, sorry, to disappoint you. Because those two were inseparable, when Nino is left alone, she is suffering a lot. Because of loneliness she wants to scream and in order to stop her soul to scream out loud she starts to wear a mask over her mouth. Everything would have been amazing, or kind of, if she didn't meet a boy called Yuzu one day when she had he breakdown. And so he asks her to sing his songs when she is having her breakdowns. Long story short, something again happens and Nino is left alone again, but now, she is singing when she wants to scream. Several years pass and now all of our main characters are high school students, but are they the same? Could it be that Nino can be reunited with Momo? Or something absolutely different is awaiting her? That's for you to find out if you start reading this manga. \\n Now, a bit about the style of the manga and why I chose this particular one for today. I have read another work by Ryouko Fukuyama, Monochrome Kids, though it is still being translated in English and I am thinking of reading it in German. I can say with utmost certainty that if somebody would have told me a year ago that I will be reading and understanding manga, I would have laughed. To say the truth I've tried one about 5 years ago. For me it was just some pictures and words, I was always confused from where to start reading. I just wasn't having fun. I don't know what, but somehow around a year ago everything changed. I got a taste of ut and I liked it. But even now sometimes I'm lost when I am reading manga about music or arts. The author has to express his ideas and emotion through black & white world of drawings and words. \\n When I was reading Unmasked Noise, I felt all the characters to the extent that I thought they were real, that they lived around me. I got why they are so stupid, but the best part was that I was really feeling the music through the pictures and it was amazing. I think it was as if I was listening to the screams and songs while reading. I only had the same experience with Chiba Kozue's Crayon Days, where through black & white I actually was seeing all 24 colors of palette. I guess, the next time I will write about that one. \\n When I was reading Unmasked Noise, I was on edge every time. I was intrigued by everyone's past and was cheering them on their future. The characters are portrayed as real people, they are not the best people in the world, nor are they the worst.

       "  \"see full review @ Katie's Corner \\n I think this particular manga has been on my to-read list for at least half a year. Somehow, I always found other things to read or just plainly ignored it. And now for some reason, it is the very first one to be reviews on my blog. Fate? I don't know about that. But as soon as I took up this manga the first 22 chapters went so fast I couldn't believe myself, and then I was waiting for about 2 weeks for the next chapter to be translated. Now I have to wait for even more... \\n First let's talk a bit about the plot. I think the summary doesn't give us a lot, but at the same time it intrigues enough to start reading. Let's say we have three main characters: Nino, Momo and Yuzu (Nino is a girl and Momo and Yuzu are guys). Nino and Momo are childhood friends, who are very, very fond of each other. They are always together doing stuff and especially sing different songs. Because of some circumstances Momo's family has to move away and those two promise each other that their singing will be the sign to bring them together in the future. \\n Now, you'll think total childhood friendship cliche. Well, sorry, to disappoint you. Because those two were inseparable, when Nino is left alone, she is suffering a lot. Because of loneliness she wants to scream and in order to stop her soul to scream out loud she starts to wear a mask over her mouth. Everything would have been amazing, or kind of, if she didn't meet a boy called Yuzu one day when she had he breakdown. And so he asks her to sing his songs when she is having her breakdowns. Long story short, something again happens and Nino is left alone again, but now, she is singing when she wants to scream. Several years pass and now all of our main characters are high school students, but are they the same? Could it be that Nino can be reunited with Momo? Or something absolutely different is awaiting her? That's for you to find out if you start reading this manga. \\n Now, a bit about the style of the manga and why I chose this particular one for today. I have read another work by Ryouko Fukuyama, Monochrome Kids, though it is still being translated in English and I am thinking of reading it in German. I can say with utmost certainty that if somebody would have told me a year ago that I will be reading and understanding manga, I would have laughed. To say the truth I've tried one about 5 years ago. For me it was just some pictures and words, I was always confused from where to start reading. I just wasn't having fun. I don't know what, but somehow around a year ago everything changed. I got a taste of ut and I liked it. But even now sometimes I'm lost when I am reading manga about music or arts. The author has to express his ideas and emotion through black & white world of drawings and words. \\n When I was reading Unmasked Noise, I felt all the characters to the extent that I thought they were real, that they lived around me. I got why they are so stupid, but the best part was that I was really feeling the music through the pictures and it was amazing. I think it was as if I was listening to the screams and songs while reading. I only had the same experience with Chiba Kozue's Crayon Days, where through black & white I actually was seeing all 24 colors of palette. I guess, the next time I will write about that one. \\n When I was reading Unmasked Noise, I was on edge every time. I was intrigued by everyone's past and was cheering them on their future. The characters are portrayed as real people, they are not the best people in the world, nor are they the worst. They are just people; they are high school students, who have their own dreams, fears, expectations and obligations. They are in love, but they all have to forget that feeling for the time being, first is to show each other that they are there, that their voices can reach their loved one hearts. \\n I really hope that this review was at least a bit helpful, I tried not to spoil (which was quite hard, because I want to say so much more). I guess I will just write another review when all the chapters are translated and I finish reading them. Christmas is just in a few days. Have great holidays and have fun! \\n XOXO \\n Katie\"),\n",

       "  \"I bought this series of trade paperbacks back in the mid to late 90s when they first came out and have read them occasionally through the years. It's been a few years now and thought I'd visit them again. They never get old. The story, the artwork, everything about it is pretty timeless. \\n The writing is fantastic, very dark but with enough humor to not be depressing. There are many great one liners. The characters feel pretty fleshed out, even in the short time we get to know them in this volume, though most of their backstory comes in subsequent volumes. The villains are quite terrifying, and there are some seriously nasty situations for all those involved. \\n The artwork is equally fantastic. Apart from the racist Texas sheriff and the Saint of Killers, everyone has their own face. The sheriff and the saint are very similar, long gaunt shape though. They do definitely have differences, but they are much more subtle. Cassidy occasionally looks a little goofy, but other times really well done. The color is occasionally a little flat, sometimes really great, but mostly just pretty decent. The line work is where the art really shines though. Closeups of faces are awesome. Many panels have great movement, despite it not being a terribly action heavy comic. \\n The covers shown inside, while being a little 90's era super beefy, are exceptional. Particularly the one with Cassidy and the bloody mouth, which is equally cool and frightening. \\n It's amazing how well this comic holds up 20 years later. There aren't any obvious signs of the times. There is one instance where the internet is mentioned, almost in passing, but it's like Jessee hasn't a clue what it is. 1995 was pretty early days for the internet though. Otherwise, cars are pretty nondescript, or old beaters, anyway, so they don't stand out as particularly old. There are no cell phones, of course, but it doesn't really feel like there needs to be (if this was set in present day). Well, maybe when Tool gets in his car accident and tries calling for backup. \\n This volume is really an introduction to a lot of things. It's fairly short (about 200 pages). Jessee gets possessed by Genesis and learns just a bit about it. Tulip is along for the ride, but at this point we don't know much about her. Cassidy helps out and we learn that he's a lovable but frightening vampire. The saint of killers is revived by the Adephi, the keepers of Genesis (and the bookkeepers of Heaven). God quit and Jessee is aiming to put him to task for it. \\n Sideline stuff has racist stereotype Texas Sheriff Hugo Root. Despite him being an absolutely horrible person I loved the character. His son, who becomes the famed Arseface. I realized he doesn't know what 'arse' means, at least at one point. I wonder if he learned what it meant before he called himself arseface? \\n An issue at the end with Cassidy's friend, turned out to be a serial killer, and the cops chasing him. One a total doofus and the other a closet 'Anal Rampager.' \\n This is easily one of my favorite graphic novels. I have read it many times and always really love it. Definitely not for kids or the weak of mind/spirit/heart. It is very violent, there is a lot of swearing, and there are more than a few hints of kinks from the, shall we say, more underground of sexual acts (though no actual nudity). Certainly, it's vulgar, but so is life, and the writing is done so well.\"),\n",

       "  'All the elements you\\'d expect from a good Indiana Jones story are present in The Fate of Atlantis, but that doesn\\'t mean the Dark Horse graphic novel (originally a mini-series) is actually good. \\n In fact, it is pretty awful. \\n But before I talk about how awful The Fate of Atlantis is, here\\'s what an Indy story needs: \\n 1. Indy searching for a dangerous artifact surrounded by a mysterious and powerful myth. Check. \\n 2. Indy hopping from continent to continent. Check. \\n 3. Indy running around with a beautiful girl in tow. Check. \\n 4. Indy racing against Nazis or some other anti-\"free world\" bogey-enemy. Check. \\n 5. Indy getting shot and/or knifed and/or thoroughly pummeled. Check. \\n 6. Indy moving from one chase sequence to another, one action sequence to another. Check. \\n 7. Indy always keeping his hat on. Check. \\n If nothing else, The Fate of Atlantis scores in each and every category. What a shame that these elements aren\\'t executed better. I\\'ll get to how they\\'re not in a minute, but first I need to talk about the character of Indiana Jones. \\n You see, the crew at Dark Horse comics (undoubtedly green lit by the ever questionable George Lucas) never captured the spirit of Indy. Sure he does all the things he\\'s supposed to do, but he never does them right. His playfulness is forced, his relationship with Sophia (his psychic link to Atlantis) is as convincing as Richard M. Nixon\\'s \"I\\'m not a crook\" speech, and his dialogue has more in common with the worst of Mike Hammer than with the Indiana Jones of film (he repeatedly says, \"Eureka,\" and I can guarantee he\\'s never said \"Eureka\" anywhere in any film). When Indy isn\\'t Indy, and he sure isn\\'t Indy in The Fate of Atlantis, the adventure is in serious trouble. \\n And that trouble is compounded by nearly every classic ingredient that should have made the story a winner. \\n Atlantis and its supply of orichalcum, a sort of Greek God plutonium, is too silly, too \"made up,\" to sustain the story. Indy\\'s travels from continent to continent are a bit of a joke, driven more by obligation than the requirements of the story. Sophia is intended as a wacky Katherine Hepburn-style \"girl Friday,\" but her execution is more like Whoopie Goldberg in Ghost. The Nazis of The Fate of Atlantis are even less frightening than the Nazis in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. The action sequences, beyond their natural and acceptable diminishment from screen to page, are so uninspired that Indy gets shot in the shoulder...by a Nazi...again. \\n Yep, The Fate of Atlantis is crap, and even the art is boring. \\n So why two stars? Well...I am a sucker for Indiana Jones (even bad Indiana Jones), and I read it with my son. He thought it was pretty damn cool, so that\\'s enough to make me think it was okay. But only just.'),\n",

       "  \"Originally posted in My Book Musings. \\n I don't know what happened. \\n Suddenly, for November, I just stopped reading. Completely. No books (of all genres, even my favorites), no graphic novels, or even simple comic strips. Nada. I just didn't have the drive to read anymore. My family and friends were confused and worried because I'm the biggest bookworm they know. \\n Then one time my boyfriend asked me to go with him to ATC for the launching of Trese: Midnight Tribunal and to get his complete set signed. I have honestly never read the series prior to that day, but I did buy him the 5th book to show my support for his interests (yay, support Filipino authors!). \\n Fast-track to that day, I quietly listened to the interesting questions of the interviewee, Yvette Tan (author of Waking the Dead). I was quite amused by the apparent interest of the attendees. I didn't know they already have quite a following! The interest of the attendees aroused my interest as well so then and there I borrowed my man's five books to read them myself. \\n I left the books on my bedroom floor for about a week before I found myself looking for something to bring to the hospital to read while waiting (for a checkup). I gave up and picked up the first book of Trese. I think I finished it in an hour or less. And finished all five books in three days. It's that good. \\n For those who have not yet heard of Trese, it is a graphic novel series about the adventures of Alexandra Trese as a detective for paranormal crimes in our very own Philippines. I just love reading books situated in our country. What sets the series apart is that it uses the folklore that we Filipinos all grew up with - the stories about the aswang, tikbalang, nuno sa punso and the like - coupled by our very own streets - Balete Drive, Ayala, etc - so it was very easy to get lost in the story and feel like you're right there and that it's all very real. \\n The creators of Trese, Budgette Tan (writer) and Kajo Baldisimo (graphic artist), were quirky and funny during the book launch, and their talent and humor certainly is evident in the five books. Budgette sure knows how to spin a tale, and Kajo's art just keeps getting better and better. \\n At first, my boyfriend didn't want me to read the graphic novels because I am such a scaredy-cat and I frequently have very vivid nightmares (murder, my death, ghosts, etc) so he didn't want to add to my overactive subconscious. But I insisted, despite my own misgivings. \\n I am so glad I didn't let my fear get in the way. I don't know if the other fans of Trese get scared while reading the series, but I really wasn't. I think it's because Alexandra Trese is just so bad-ass and such an interesting character that I actually felt 'safe' while reading it. \\n Yes, yes, I recommend the book, and not just because I like supporting Filipino authors, and that I'm super in love with it, but because it's truly marvelous to read. Definitely five stars for me - each and every book. It's not a waste of time and money (I actually wish I could buy my own set and not just borrow my boyfriend's). For international, non-Filipino readers, you can still enjoy the book as it's in English! \\n This was actually the first-ever book launch I've ever attended and I'm so glad I did. I actually had fun, even if I was not able to relate to the interest then. I certainly do now! Looking forward to the next Trese graphic novels. Kudos, Budgette and Kajo! :)\"),\n",

       "  \"This is definitely one of those philosophical/religious/life-altering sort of books that I feel everyone should read no matter what religious or ethnic background they are. And to think that such stimulating substance could come from something much of society would find puerile shows that comics are no longer a childhood storybook with superheros, but instead a piece of art. I couldn't imagine this story to be told in any other way than a graphic novel, for there is some sequences that cannot simply be read but must be seen to further envelop the reader into the story. The artwork is masterful with so many intricacies I could have stared at all the little details for days and once I re-read this book I'm sure I'll find thousands of more things that didn't catch my eye to begin with. \\n Without going into too much detail of what happens, for I cannot do the story justice, there are many viewpoints that must be discussed. Coming from a relatively religious-less home I did not know much about the stories of the Bible or the Qu'ran, so I was very intrigued to find the similar differences between stories that were told along with the main narrative about these foreign-to-me-texts. I couldn't find any prejudice to one religion or the other so I wouldn't feel awkward loaning this book out to both my very Christian friend and my very Muslim friend. See this book showed me that it really isn't about religion but simply philosophy. Like most philosophy ideals, this book helps the reader to see the world different, whether it be slightly or paramount. This story runs the gamut of subjects: human right, religion, society, prostitution, philosophy, life and death, parenthood, slavery and above all else love covered in great detail between the covers. \\n At its core Habibi is an endearing love story that does not have the simple formula that many romance novels of today have. There were times when I was expecting the plot to go one way but instead went an entirely new direction and once I got to the final page I couldn't help but want to follow the characters even further to their deaths. Not to say that one could not surmise that the characters lived happily ever after, I just simply didn't want it to end. Even though some might shy away upon initial skim through the pages due to nudity, which the book has more than its fair share of, I would hope that those people would persevere and see if it doesn't change their lives.\"),\n",

       "  'Thor #360 -- \"Into the Valley of Death\": If my memory serves, my favourite stretch of Walt Simonson\\'s The Mighty Thor is about to begin, but before we get there Simonson needs to tie up the loose ends of the Surtur battle and add some new stitches for what\\'s to come. To that end, we get the Asgardians returning from Midgard to begin the rebuilding of the Golden Realm; we get Frigga holding onto Odin\\'s Great Sceptre until a new ruler can be chosen; we get Sif pouting over being punched by Thor, even though she knows he struck her because he was under the spell of Loki (apparently this thread is going to need more time to be tied off); we get the Warriors Three back bearing cheesy gifts; and we get -- oddest of all -- the Einherjar adopting the automatic weapons of the US Army. Now we have gun toting Asgardians. But all of this (well ... most of it) is about to be put aside for Thor\\'s journey to Hel. Sweet. \\n Thor #361 -- \"The Quick and the Dead\": For fans of Norse Mythology, Thor\\'s journey to Hel is one of the best issues written by Simonson. Garm guards the gates of Hel, while Hel(a) rules the lowest reaches of Yggdrasil with her decaying touch. Balder\\'s wife Nan[n]a shows up in a cool cameo, and we even see creepy Modgud who\\'s busy guarding Gjallarbru, the bridge to Hel. And for fans of the comics we get the horrific scarring of Thor\\'s beautiful face. It\\'s a moment that I remember most fondly from all those years ago, and I\\'ve always loved the way Simonson chose to render the horror. It\\'s all left to our imagination. Thor\\'s face, mangled and mauled during his wrestling match with Hel, is all in black shadow. We can\\'t tell how bad the damage is by looking at Thor, but we can tell how bad the damage is by watching the reactions (and reading the thoughts) of those around him. Their reactions ain\\'t pretty, and neither is Thor anymore. \\n Thor #362 -- \"Like a Bat Out of Hell\": Thor is entering his grim phase now that his face is destroyed, which is a big plus for the coming issues, but this issue is most interesting because of the Executioner\\'s (Skurge\\'s) redemptive act of sacrifice. He destroys Naglfar (the ship made from the toe and fingernails of the dead) with his axe, then he holds the rear of Thor\\'s column, fighting off the hordes of the dead that Hel sends against the Asgardians. It\\'s pretty cool, actually, though not as emotionally stirring as it sounds. Skurge is a bit of a putz, after all. \\n Thor #363 -- \"This Kursed Earth\": If there is anything I hate about comics, it is when Marvel or DC decide to do a multi-issue, multi-title cross over series. Money grab aside, I\\'ve never found that style of storytelling coherent enough to be a complete success. Even the Civil War (which I consider the best of the bunch) was too uneven to be called truly exceptional. As far as I know, though, Secret Wars II and all its crossovers, of which this issue of The Mighty Thor is one, is where all this multi-madness began. So we get the Beyonder wandering around Earth, fucking with superheroes to educate himself, and blah blah blah. The issue is pretty poor. It\\'s mostly a slug fest between Thor and Kurse (with cameos from Beta Ray Bill and Power Pack), and it\\'s a huge disappointment after Thor\\'s kick ass journey to hell. At least we get brooding, wounded, scarred up Thor when he\\'s not duking it out with Kurse, and Thor in this state is about as compelling as Thor gets, so the hint of this Thor mitigates the Secret Wars tie in just a touch. \\n It\\'s not a great issue, but it sets up something very, very cool: the last page sees a Loki spell, channeling the power of Surtur\\'s sword, coming to fruition. A charmed woman walks up to Thor and gives him a smooch. And the next thing you know ... Thor\\'s a frog. Super sweet! \\n Thor #364 -- \"Thor Croaks!\": So my friend Manny Rayner is reading Ulysses, and I am reading The Mighty Thor. At least my book has a talking frog, and that frog is Thor himself. As the issue opens, Frigga declares the \"Great Althing\" to decide on a new ruler of Asgard will take place in a fortnight. Loki shows up with a smile on his face, certain that Thor won\\'t make it because he\\'s become an amphibian. Meanwhile, Thor finds himself embroiled in a Central Park war between the Rats and the Frogs, and giant, ass-kicking Bull Frog that Thor is, he lends his power to the battle and aids the Frogs. A fortnight later, he\\'s engaged in a plan to attack the Rats in their sewer home, when he stumbles upon a Pied Piper. The lilting tones of the Piper\\'s pipe enslave Thor, and we leave him jumping into the mouths of a dozen sewer alligators. While back in Asgard, Loki steps up at the Althing only to find Thor (Thor?) join him on stage (a plan cooked up by Heimdall and Harokin). What the fuck is going on? I\\'ll fill you in tomorrow. \\n Thor #365 -- \"Guess Who\\'s Coming to Dinner, or It\\'s Not Easy Being Green.\": Turns out the Piper is a Morlock, and when it comes down to it he admires the big bullfrog\\'s determination (even Frog Thor is tenatious), so he recovers his pipe and sets his alligators on the rat armies to aid the Frog of Thunder. It\\'s easy to mock this strange detour in the Thor story, but my fondness has been reiforced during this rereading. I love this story. I love Thor as a frog fighting a war against the rats. Moreover, the spell cast by Loki seems to fit with the sort of mischief Loki was famous for in the real Norse Myths, giving this a touch of old world charm that many of the other Thor stories could use. To finish this disjointed entry: the best part of the issue is when Frog Thor lifts Mjolnir and becomes a 6\\'6\" Frog Thor, standing tall and driving his chariot into the heavens. Thor has never looked better. Really. \\n Thor #366 -- \"Sir!\": Loki\\'s plans are about to come to fruition. He turns the tables on Heimdall\\'s ruse to buy time, lifting Harokin\\'s fake Mjolnir (Harokin is standing in for the missing Thor), thus proving himself worthy of the power of Thor to the huddled masses of Asgard. So who should rule Asgard? Loki, of course. Not so fast, though. Frog Thor shows up and starts kicking Loki\\'s ass. The God of Mischief is about to end up in Hel, but elsewhere in Asgard, Volstagg bumps into a mountainside and drops an avalanche onto the magic machine that is tapping the mystic energies of Surtur\\'s sword, thus making the Frog spell work. The spell breaks, Thor is restored, Loki is saved, and the \"brothers\" head back to the Althing where the people of Asgard offer Thor the Asgardian crown. He refuses, though, because his vow to protect Midgard is too important to break. So he declares Balder the true ruler. Cue a drawing of Loki\\'s brain at work. You\\'re in deep doo doo, Balder. The end. \\n Too bad Frog Thor is gone :( I loved Frog Thor. \\n Thor #367 -- \"The Harvest of the Seasons\": I like to think of this as the coming of Thor\\'s beard. Balder is set to be the new Liege Lord of Asgard, and Thor is free to brood over his love for Sif and grow a neatly trimmed blonde beard to cover Hela\\'s devastation to his face. So he does. And while other things happen in this issue, like the return of Beyonder\\'s buddy, Kurse, the return of Malekith, the obligatory scheming of Loki, and Sif\\'s most recent decision to run off with Horse-Face Bill, all that really matters to me is Thor\\'s beard. Nice choice, Walt. It fit Thor so well, he was sporting the beard this past summer. \\n Thor #368 -- \"The Eye of the Beholder\": All that Kurse and Malekith stuff is resolved as this issue opens, but Balder still hasn\\'t arrived to be crowned, so Thor drags Fandral, Volstagg and Hogun out of Asgard to search for the Brave one who has fallen prey to yet another bit of Loki scheming (shocking isn\\'t it?). \\n But that is when things get really good because I was able to twist everything in my mind. I turned Thor #368 into Star Trek - The Original Series, Season 4, Episode 1. Captain Kirk (Balder) is tricked into the lair of some Big Bad Alien (Slaggnbir the Troll), where he is forced to fight the BBA to save three Beautiful Space Women -- Gertha, Unn and Kossi -- who turn out to be the real danger because as soon as Kirk has killed the BBA, the BSW trigger amnesia in Kirk and turn him into their sex slave. Meanwhile, Mr. Spock (Bearded Thor) stumbles upon the Spaceship of the BBA (the castle), and when he walks into the ship, he finds the BSW controlling his Captain. Cue cliffhanger music and the half time commercial. Conclusion of TOS 4.1 tomorrow in my recounting of Thor #369. Bet you\\'re as excited as I am. \\n Thor #368 -- \"For Whom the Belles Troll\": Captain\\'s Log, Stardate 6125.6, First Officer Spock reporting: Following Captain Kirk\\'s disappearance while investigating the derelict vessel of the Big Bad Alien, I proceeded to the ship to conduct my own investigation. It was there that I discovered Captain Kirk in thrall to three Alien Women, undoubtedly they would be subjectively beautiful to humans. I was quick to assess the situation and realized that the Alien Women had used a set of Aesirian bobbles containing a Thrall-field and Illusion Projector. Once I destroyed their bobbles, the Alien Women were revealed as Jotnir (Trolls). Captain Kirk and I were forced to terminate them once they attacked us with murderous intent. \\n Then Captain Balder and Mr. Thor fly off into the sunset to have that drink to honour their dead comrade, Lt. Skurge, which ends the long, long arc of Asgardian tales in Simonson\\'s Thor. Back to Midgard next time, home of more \"super-hero\" driven tales; it will be a nice change, but I\\'m going to miss the Asgardian stuff.'),\n",

I think it's scary for writers to write a sequel, or an off-shoot, of a popular book/series because the sequel might not be as well received. However, with this latest juicy book, Budjette and Kajo has got the goods (oops, more pressure?). Heck, the intro alone by Budjette has got me quivering in excitement for the first page. \\n Trese: Stories from the Diabolical Volume 1 is divided into five short stories peppered with ghosts, spilling intestines, and lots of alcohol (my favorite is The Usual Spot). The protagonists of the story all come into the Diabolical, the bar owned and managed by Alexandra Trese, and bar-tended by Hank. With Hank's penchant for knowing exactly what a customer needs, he gets them to spill their sob stories. And when a crime has a paranormal angle, he relays the story to Trese. I love that Hank gets his own storyline, and his important role in the world of Alexandra Trese is finally highlighted. \\n Budjette's talent for short-but-terrific stories shines again with this latest graphic novel. In just a few pages, each story arc's main characters, plot, twist, and resolution is delivered flawlessly - and I was satisfied with each story. I thought Kajo's artistry in the first five Trese books was great, but his artwork in the Diabolical was even better! \\n One of the things that I love about Trese is that I don't get scared while, or after, reading. I'm terrified of ghost stories (and the dark and anything related to Halloween) but I just get so excited with each Trese book, maybe because of the ass-kicking Alexandra Trese, who makes me feel same somehow, coupled, of course, with the very enchanting Kambal. The ghosts in the story remain inside the story, and I walk away feeling satisfied that all is right with the world. \\n I mentioned above that I think writing sequels is scary for writers, but I'm actually the type of reader who is also wary of sequels and spin-offs because they might not be at par with my expectations due to my enjoyment of the first book/series. But man, Budjette and Kajo just keep proving to me that I have nothing to fear. I'm now even more impatient for the sixth Trese book (and perhaps even a Volume 2?). \\n If you've always been afraid of the kapres, the aswangs, the dead, ghosts, and whatnots, mayhap Trese will change your mind. I think Trese: Stories from the Diabolical is a good introduction into the fantastic world that is Trese. Be warned though: You might not ever want to get out. \\n Happy Halloween! \\n My Book Musings\"),\n",

       "  \"see full review @ Katie's Corner \\n I'm continuing with my obsession with Mayu Shinjo's works. However, there are not much left. There definitely be two more reviews, but at that I won't be able to review all of her works, and truly I only review the ones that I found interesting enough to read a second time. But let me get back to the review as talking about my future projects is sometimes boring \\n Please bear in mind that from all of the author's work this is the cruelest. Wait, can I say cruel? Let me elaborate. It's twisted. The story is about love, but Hakuron's (that's the main character and the leader of Hong Kong mafia) idea of love is twisted. The story has lots of murder and also rape, which is why I say that his idea of love is twisted. But what is most interesting is that he truly does love Kurumi, and that love makes him do stupid things. Like what? Heh, If I told you I would have spoiled a major event and to say the truth I would have spoiled the whole story. Because before he does anything there are characters to appear and make Kurumi's life hell and take her love from her. \\n Why do I love this story if it's mostly murder and twisted love? I believe because of the characters. No matter what cruelty Hakuron does, even if he infuriates me to the point of hating him, I still like him as a character. He truly encompassed the role of a heartless, cruel beast that unfortunately falls in love. Why unfortunately? That is my opinion, but if he didn't he would have been alive and wouldn't have wounded Kurumi, but at the same time the love that he felt towards Kurumi made him a better man in some aspects. Kurumi is a great character. Her strength and her love amaze me every time I read this story. You might think of her as strange. She should have run when she had a chance, but she stayed. She loved Hakuron too much. \\n I mean if we look at the ending, and it's something that I didn't expect.

       "  \"Probably about 3.5, maybe could stretch to 4. \\n It said this was somewhat based on characters from The Dark Tower, but then later it said it was original characters by the author. So I'm not sure what it is. Either way, I don't really remember these characters in Dark Tower, though it has been a while since I read the series. \\n The story follows 4 siblings, each with a different sort of demonic/horror imbued trait. The eldest is a vampire, another brother is a werewolf, the sister is a demon/witch and the youngest cannot die (has no soul?). The elder three are nasty types and the youngest (Silas) tries to turn them back to good. Silas was always the odd one out, beaten the worst as a kid by their false preacher father. He had a savior in a neighbor who kept him on the side of good. The book generally follows a timeline when they are adults, mixed with flashbacks to when they were kids. There is brief mention of a mother that was sacrificed and died and something to do with demons and the nasty father trying to draw upon unholy power. It's all so wispy though because there was so much that happened but nothing is covered enough to give any weight. \\n This book is a bit of a missed opportunity. It's a standalone book in 4 issues/chapters. I think the characters are interesting enough to be a series, if not a 3 volume set. Everything just moved too fast. It felt like an abridged version of the story with too much happening between the panels. It's a shame, because the horror elements are great. The characters and story are great, at least what's there. \\n The artwork is very dark, loose, and messy. It wouldn't be for everyone and it's sometimes hard to tell what's actually going on. It does, more or less, fit the book, but I wish it was a little easier to parse.\"),\n",

       "  '*Won in a Goodreads First Reads contest* \\n In 2008 (has it been that long?) I read Watchmen. To this day, I look back at that book fondly. I was upset with the movie for failing to adapt the work appropriately - being, for once, too true to the source material to work as a film - but have raved about the novel to a few folk who still are nervous about something with so many pictures. There have been many times where I have flipped through it and my initial thought flames through my head before I remember the joy of the book ... man, I hate the artwork in that novel. \\n I mean, I understand the reason why it is drawn the way it is drawn. I get it; how it must match up with the styles of the Golden Age of Comics to truly be as powerful as it is. And I remember that a chapter in or so, the art didn\\'t bother me as much. But still ... \\n Enter Before Watchmen. \\n The past few weeks I\\'ve seen ads and, slowly, the books appearing on shelves in stores. They sit so close to the source but in my eyes, they were miles away. Why milk the cash cow more? You can only ruin it. \\n Still, when all of them were up on the Goodreads contests, I figured, if I win them, I\\'ll give them a chance. Well, I won the Comedian/Rorschach collection. First things first, the art was more in line with what I had been hoping for at the start. Gorgeous, markedly different between the two storylines (J.G. Jones plays with the panels quite a bit more than Lee Bermejo; Bermejo\\'s work feels more realistic than Jones\\'s) and instantly drawing me in. I wanted to read this from the first flip. \\n But is it worth reading? \\n For those of you wanting Watchmen, this isn\\'t it. There are no layers and deeper meanings (at least, not as many) as what Alan Moore put into that classic. These vignettes aren\\'t really meant to be the same thing. They are meant to take the characters created to tell a specific story and spin them off into their own series. While there are specific references made to the imagery of Watchmen (and probably specific backstory parts that were referred to in Watchmen ... it\\'s been 5 years), these pieces aren\\'t really prequels to that novel. More like really well done fan-fiction. \\n Comedian \\n Of the two, this is the one that felt more in line with Watchmen. Focusing on Comedian\\'s stint in the Vietnam war felt like an ironic take on all \"superhero fights for the US in xx War\"; paying homage and refracting into twisted and ugly focus what those comics were designed for and what they really showed. I do feel more sympathy for Comedian through the reading of this piece and could easily have spent all 250 pages of this book reading about his history. The historical references felt appropriate and pushed forward his character like ocean waves throwing a raft around. An excellent start to the collection. \\n Rorschach \\n I needed more to fully buy into this one. Possibly an issue\\'s worth of prologue that would answer questions like: When did the Bard start this crime wave? What brings Rorschach to it? Where were his first leads? This seemed to be a bumbling hero\\'s first attempt at solving a crime ... but it missed the important opening remarks. Not to say there wasn\\'t some fun involved. Extremely violent (more in-panel violence than in Comedian\\'s story ... fittingly, if I remember correctly), dark and gritty, it\\'s like two thirds of a real good Batman story. \\n Final Notes \\n Not as deep, but prettier than Watchmen. And it definitely makes me want to read the rest of the BW series and, of course, revisit the source itself. If you are willing to let your mind allow for a modern take on the characters created to discuss superheroes ... you will probably enjoy it. Don\\'t know if you\\'ll want to own it, but it\\'s worth the couple of hours it takes to soak it all in.'),\n",

       "  'I feel like reviewing each issue as I go, so here goes. \\n Thor #349 -- \"Debts of Honour\": One of my favourite things about Simonson\\'s time on The Mighty Thor is that the comic is really just an excuse to play around in Asgard. Thor always makes an obligatory appearance, but he isn\\'t always the most important character. This issue casts Odin in the lead, as he recounts the tale of how he and his brothers, Vili & Ve, stumbled into Muspellsheim, pissed off the fire demon Surtur, shattered Surtur\\'s sword, stole the Eternal Flame and sealed Surtur into the southern fire kingdom of Yggdrasil (you\\'re a dumb ass, Odin). Baldur the Brave makes another important appearance, proving once again to be the most \"heroic\" of Simonson\\'s pantheon. And since the universe is in deep, deep, Odin crafted shit, Odin calls upon the most obvious hero to save Yggdrasil: Beta Ray Bill (because he is as powerful as Thor). And Thor himself ... he is currently under the sway of a love potion. What a schmuck. So Odin is an idiot, Baldur is the bravest, Beta Ray Bill is a competent space Thor, and Thor is an incompetent boob. That about sums it up. \\n Thor #350 -- \"Ragnarok and Roll\": In case you don\\'t believe me that Simonson\\'s Thor is an incompetent boob, Surtur, bad ass Muspel-Demon, tricks him into make a rainbow, which, of course, reveals the Rainbow Bridge, and while Thor is busy fighting off Surtur\\'s demon hordes, the fiery PapaDemon slips across space and time to Asgard and takes the fight to Heimdall. \\n For big, chaotic battle sequences (shockingly similar to the Chitauri battle in this past summer\\'s Avengers movie), the battle for Manhattan that pits the armies of Asgard against the demons of Muspellsheim is good enough, but it leaves little room for character development, which bums me out. There is, however, one excellent sequence. The Enchantress, one of Asgard\\'s biggest villainesses, volunteers to help Odin protect Asgard (along with all of Thor\\'s other godlike foes, barring Loki), and mid-battle she goes *POP* over to her cousin\\'s Manhattan apartment to convince Lorelei to join the fight. When Lorelei refuses, Enchantress slams her for her selfishness and vows to take her and her spells down when the fight is over. Then *POP* she\\'s back in the battle. It\\'s a nice touch in an otherwise standard battle comic. \\n Sadly, though, the fight\\'s not over yet. \\n Thor #351 -- \"Ragnarok and Roll, Too\": You remember how I said that the big battle was like the Avenger\\'s movie last summer? It became even moreso when the demons opened up a sky gate above the Empire State Building. But if recent Marvel film history didn\\'t borrow enough from Mr. Simonson, there is also the little issue of the Bifrost being shattered at Heimdall\\'s feet (much like the final battle in the Thor movie). This time it was Surtur with his gargantuan sword who did the deed, but the bridge is broken and only Odin, Heimdall and Thor are left in Asgard to fight the big demon. \\n Wait a second, though. The only one left to fight the demon is Odin, The Pragmatic Father. He admits in the final moment that he could have saved Thor during his one on one battle with the Demon, but he chose to let Surtur kill the God of Thunder because the battle weakened the demon just enough for Odin to destroy him. Sweet. The good of the many, hey Mr. Spock? \\n As the issue goes, it is more of the same. So much is happening at the moment that little can be done with character. Still, the Fantastic Four joined the fray, as did the US Armed Forces, so the Marvel world is reacting to what\\'s happening, which is the minimum required to flirt with reality. Apart from that, nothing new develops. Beta Ray Bill is still as tough as Thor. Sif is still a reactionary who does what she wants. The villains of Asgard are still fighting. Blah blah blah. \\n I\\'m looking forward to the end of this battle. I prefer the quieter issues. \\n Thor #352 -- \"Ragnarok and Ruin\": It\\'s a Thor free Mighty Thor. Everyone else is duking it out while Thor lies comatose (and nowhere to be seen in these pages) on the broken Bifrost. So what\\'s happening elsewhere in this Nine World\\'s spanning battle? Ex-cop Roger Willis flies off to Svartelheim to fix the Casket of Ancient Winters. He has a super fast Fantastic Four plane as transport, the Human Torch for protection, and some super glue (seriously!) to put the broken casket back together. The Avengers, some X-Men, the Asgardians and the rest of the FF are fighting in New York with Beta Ray Bill. And Odin and Surtur are duking it out in Asgard for the Eternal Flame. The battle rages for the entire book, so there is not much to report but that there is much action all leading to the moment when Surtur touches his sword (Twilight) to the eternal flame. Now ... all hell should break loose, right? \\n Thor #353 -- \"Doom II\": Wrong because it is the big finale, and Surtur just can\\'t win. Remember that I mentioned Loki couldn\\'t be found anywhere? He was in Asgard all the time, casting an illusion of the Eternal Flame, and when this issue kicks off it is just Loki vs. Surtur, but soon enough everything starts to swing the Asgardians\\' way. Odin is back in the fight. Thor joins his brother and father. And one of the coolest covers in Thor-dom comes to fruition: \\n The three of them have at Surtur each with their own battle cry: Odin: For Asgard! \\n Thor: For Midgard! \\n Loki: For Myself!It doesn\\'t get much better than that. \\n Thor #354 -- \"Pickin\\' Up the Pieces\": Hel hath no fury like a Thor pissed off. Hela shows up to claim Odin\\'s body because his power is no longer palpable throughout the Nine Worlds (he\\'s still trapped in Muspellsheim locked in perpetual battle with Surtur, according to Loki that is), and Thor goes full out Storm God on her ass, scaring the Mistress of Hel back to her land before entrusting now empty Asgard to Heimdall and wandering off into the snow to brood and pout for a while (before getting trapped in an avalanche). Thor tells us it is mourning, a particularly human experience, that he now must face for the first time. I just think it is a plot device to get us ready for the next adventure (and to set us up for the nice break in the next issue). A interesting fact about #354: it\\'s the most Thor we\\'ve had in this volume of Simonson\\'s run. \\n Thor #355 -- \"The Icy Hearts\": Oh! how I love this issue. Most people would probably find it too sentimental or too quiet for their tastes, but the nostalgic me always remembers this as a beautiful Thor tale, and I wasn\\'t disappointed this time through. \\n Thor has been rescued from the avalanche that almost killed him, and he\\'s sleeping on a bed of furs while a giant hand tosses Mjolnir up and down, up and down, like a kids toy. Pan back and we see Tiwaz, an old God (or giant?) with a big white beard and Asgardian garb. Tiwaz plays host to Thor and nurses him back to strength, wrestling with the Thunder God every night so that Thor can \"earn\" his dinner. Thor becomes convinced that Tiwaz is Odin in disguise, and his spirits begins to return to normal. He eventually throws Tiwaz, much to the big man\\'s delight, and Thor is officially ready to take on the rulership of Asgard. It\\'s such a simple tale -- sort of like Thor\\'s mind -- but it speaks to me of kindness, care, home, warmth, love. Thor was lucky to bump into old Tiwaz , who just happens to be the Thunderer\\'s great-grandpa , and we are lucky to have a breather before the guts and glory storylines return. \\n Thor #356 -- \"The Power and the Pride!\": Walt Simonson took a break for a month, and we get a fun little issue about Hercules and Thor. Since this volume is about Simonson\\'s Thor, however, we don\\'t get the Hercules joy. \\n Thor #357 -- \"A New Deal From an Old Deck, or the Credit Card Soldiers\": Two adventures in one. Beta Ray Bill and Sif battle some armor clad bank robbers who shrink into playing cards, effectively disappearing, at the touch of a button, while Thor and Frigga bring the children back to shattered Asgard. The first adventure is a front for some shady character with glowing yellow eyes, and it\\'s quick fun, but nothing special. The second contains a wonderful moment when some Frost Giants attack and try to eat the Asgardian whelps. The wonderful moment? Thor is about to kill the giants as they are running away, but Frigga stops him and asks him to leave them some food because they are obviously starving. We need more Frigga\\'s in our adventure stories. Don\\'t you think? \\n Oh yeah, Lorelei shows up in the final frames and renews her love spells on Thor: this time with some Loki-strengthened aroma therapy. \\n Oh yeah, again. Enchantress booby traps Odin\\'s scepter as a trap for Loki, which he dutifly springs, but we\\'re not sure of its impact yet. \\n Thor #357 -- \"When Dalliance Was in Flower, or Take the Cash and Let the Credit Go\": Thor\\'s back in Asgard and falling deeper and deeper under Lorlie\\'s spell. Meanwhile, Beta Ray Bill stops the Credit Card Soldiers from destroying the U.S. economy by revealing to the angry Vietnam vets in Golden Armour are bing manipulated by the nasty Soviets under the direction of Iron Man\\'s old foe, Titanium Man. It\\'s easy to forget that this was written way back in 1985. \\n The Beta Ray Bill stuff is mere filler, and it\\'s totally unnecessary. I wonder more and more what the point of Bill is. Surely Simonson could have had the Warriors Three wander around New York with Sif and do the same thing, but I suppose since he created Bill he feels a necessity to use him. I can increasingly do without old Horseface, though (which hurts my nostalgic heart because I loved him when I was fifteen). \\n As for Thor and Lorelei and Loki: Thor has been turned back into a blithering idiot, and Lorelei has fallen equally, madly in love with Loki (thanks to the Enchantress). It seems the best laid plans of tricksters are doomed to fall apart, but right now Thor, at the behest of Lorlei, wants to make Loki the king of Asgard. We shall see. \\n Thor #359 -- \"The Grand Alliance, or Life With Loki!!!\": Enchantress to the rescue (well, with a nudge from Heimdall). Thor\\'s enthrallment to Lorelei gets worse, but he\\'s pushed into a temper tantrum when Enchantress manipulates him into walking in on Loki cuckolding him with his \"love\" (which contains a hint of FemDom action if you\\'re interested), and his will thundrous power finally kicks in, He beats Loki up a bit, then tells Loki to lift the spell, then threatens Loki with violence, then pulls off one of the best life threatening moments I can remember in all of Marvel: Thor launches Mjolnir into Asgardian orbit, grabs Loki by the throat and lifts him to the heavens, saying \"...there soars the Hammer of Thor and by royal Odin\\'s decree, it must return to hand. Nothing may bar its way! Not even the head of Loki!\" Sweet, & \\'nuff said. \\n Thus ends this episode of Brad-stalgia. I must now seek volume three in the used book piles of North America. Wish me luck (but if you happen to have vol 3 of this set of Visionaries, I would love to borrow it, and I promise I will take care of it as thought it were my own).'),\n",

       "  \"So I saw the movie first. I knew what I was getting into, for the most part. \\n A friend of mine gave me this graphic novel a couple of years back and I finally got around to reading it. Took me all of an hour. I have equal difficulties with both the movie and the source material. Namely, these are not vampires. These are monsters with vampiric tendencies. \\n For those of you who don't remember, the story follows a select few folk in Barrow, Alaska as the sun sets for the last time in 30 days (being one of the northernmost towns, it faces days of darkness during winter and an equal amount of time of daylight during the summer). Some newer vampires finally found out about this place and decided to come up and feed for 30 days. Will anyone survive against a mythic horror? \\n I will start with what I disliked about this comic and then talk a bit about the aspects that do help it rise above other vampire stories. \\n First and foremost, we get very few characters to follow around. The vampires barely have names (there are two that are given names ... and not much else) and only three of the 500 some humans in Barrow are given names (one dies within two pages of his story - the only backstory in this piece - being told). What this means is, we have no one to really identify with. When people die, we don't care. The horror factor comes only when we can empathize somewhat with the characters being terrorized, but we are not given anything with which to cling onto as readers. I know our two main characters are married, one is a sheriff and the other a deputy, their names and that's about it. This is not enough to inspire terror, horror, tension or sadness should any of them get hurt. \\n Second, the art is too far abstract for me to enjoy it as a storytelling device. I'm sure there are folk out there who will love the artwork and the use of watercolor and weird angular sprays of blood ... but for me, it was distracting and hard to decipher at times. \\n Third, certain storylines are introduced and then dropped quickly. For instance (and I don't view this as a spoiler as nothing really came of it, but...) one character mentions that his/her (unclear, see dislike number two) girlfriend is in the town and s/he wants to find her. This is mentioned once and then no further mention is made of her. Other subplots are developed a little more before finishing unresolved. So why couldn't either: a) these subplots be further developed in the comics, b) these subplots be eliminated from the story, c) the characters all get little baby stories (which would help take care of dislike one) to introduce the theme of unresolved stories (which I would still dislike) or d) some combination of a through c. \\n Fourth, time is unclear. In a place where we know there are going to be only 30 days of this, some calendar or timeline would be very helpful. I don't know how long the initial killings occurred or how long people fought or what ... all I know is that some die right as vampires arrive, some died later, and then the sun came up. Focusing too much on the violence removes one of the great ways to bring out some idea of tension and hope. \\n Now, what I liked. \\n The monsters are violent. It's great to see extreme violence in horror from time to time when it works with the monsters. Now, Vampires are not as gleefully violent as these monsters, but whatever, I dug how fangs were on these guys. I miss the sexual undertones (essential for vampires), but whatever. \\n The premise is perfect. Why hasn't anyone done this before? Great idea. \\n I think that's about it, though. \\n Overall, it was OK. Without fuller characters, it can't be more than just OK.\"),\n",

       "  \"What a Mess. \\n The biggest problem with the Secret Wars spin-offs has been their total irrelevance to ... anything. But Ultimate End is worse, because it tries to be relevant but instead just doesn't make sense. \\n I mean, you'd expect this comic to start with the mighty clash between the 616 (Main Universe) and 1610 (Ultimate Universe) universes that was foreshadowed in many of the Final Days, but didn't get enough attention in Secret Wars #1. Nope. Instead we have a mash-up of 616 and 1610 characters on the Battleworld, which they attribute to dimensional rifts, which makes absolutely no sense in the context of the Battleworld. Eventually Bendis rather weakly offers another answer, that Doom put them all together to make them fight, which also makes no sense given his characterization in Secret Wars. \\n I have absolutely no idea if there were major problems here with editorial mandate or poor communication or what, but it created a story that feels barely-canon. \\n And Ultimate End isn't very good at meeting any other goals that its creators might have set. \\n Is it a good final showcase for the Ultimate characters? Nope. There's so much emphasis put on the 616 characters that there's little chance for the Ultimates to shine one last time. (The one exception? The All-New Ultimates who at least get a few final pages.) \\n Is it a good meeting between 616 and 1610? Barely. We get some nice interactions between Starks and Hulks, that are unfortunately muddied by art that made them sometimes indistinguishable. And no one else gets much attention. (Heck, I don't even know if these 616s were really 616s. Where is Scott's phoenix-hood for example? And shouldn't Spider-Man be off in the main Secret Wars book? Chalk it up to more awful continuity, I guess. Or accept these aren't actually the 616 characters, which means they probably aren't really the 1610 characters either, which means this is all entirely pointless.) \\n Is it a good Secret Wars story? God (Doom) no. It doesn't pick up the obvious threads. It doesn't fit with the setting. And the ending when everyone gets together to go beat up Doom? Nothing comes of it. \\n What a Mess. \\n And it's a horribly insufficient ending to a setting that once was great.\"),\n",

       "  'see full review @ Katie\\'s Corner \\n When I first was raking up this manga to read I was thinking, this might be a typical vampire story thingy. Though when you are talking about manga the word typical can only be addresses to one genre: Shoujo & Romance. I think I was looking for something similar to \"Orange Marmelade\" by Seok Woo, but they have absolutely nothing in common except the word supernatural in their genre section. \\n From the very beginning it started fast, maybe even too fast, but I guess I just didn\\'t read the summary, so I was missing out a lot of stuff.

       "  'see full review @ Katie\\'s Corner \\n When I first was raking up this manga to read I was thinking, this might be a typical vampire story thingy. Though when you are talking about manga the word typical can only be addresses to one genre: Shoujo & Romance. I think I was looking for something similar to \"Orange Marmelade\" by Seok Woo, but they have absolutely nothing in common except the word supernatural in their genre section. \\n From the very beginning it started fast, maybe even too fast, but I guess I just didn\\'t read the summary, so I was missing out a lot of stuff. The author doesn\\'t solely focus on one particular character, it might be even true to say that even though Tsukimiya is a main character, and she sometimes acts as a supporting one. New volume, new chapter and a new character and all of these new characters are so different that you are lost in them, but no matter how different they may seem, they all have something in common and that is: Greed for power or in other words ambition to become the next God.

       "  'book courtesy of Image Comics through Netgalley \\n \"The writers behind the hit series Deadpool present the sad, funny, and true story of Santa Claus -- after the apocalypse!\" \\n That was enough to make me click the download button and eagerly await to start reading right away. \\n The thing is, I forgot that I \\n used \\n to love Deadpool. \\n Deadpool was about using all the comic book tropes, all the sexisms, racism, idiotic heroics, maudlin dramatics, then breaking the 4th wall and going, \"see how absurdly wrong this is?\" \\n Deadpool could behave like a neckbeard basement dweller when around the ladies, but it was always made perfectly clear that his behaviour was not okay. He could do pretty fucked up things and we\\'d read them fully aware that he was not mentally healthy, and even he realised this and claimed it made no difference since it wasn\\'t even real and he was a comic book character. All of it with the wittiest dialogue ever. \\n I don\\'t begrudge success to worthy comics or any other medium - if it\\'s good, the more people aware and buying it, the better! Alas, with success Deadpool stopped being about a disfigured man, battling cancer and mental illness, bringing up and breaking tropes, proclaiming his love for Bea Arthur, and switched to a dude making questionable jokes, with babes just fighting over each other for the dubious pleasure of his company. \\n Which is when I stopped reading it. \\n I forgot about all that, or I subconsciously hoped for a return of sanity within the insanity, so when I started reading The Last Christmas I was not ready for how ridiculously low grade it was. \\n It seriously is one dudebro joke gone way too long (they\\'re all too long by their mere existence, but you know what I mean). \\n We start with a questionable montage about how human beings never got along featuring racist caricatures of Jewish and Arabic people. \\n Comics from the 21st century or Ku Klux Klan pamphlet? \\n Then comes the Apocalypse and toxic mutant making rain, but more importantly, Mrs. Claus, fulfilling the Disposable Woman trope, so Santa has an excuse for spiralling into alcoholism and suicide (hilarious, right?!). \\n But Santa can\\'t kill himself if even one little boy or girl believes in his existence. One such boy continues to believe. So Santa decides to kill him. \\n Off he goes to meet the stereotypical white post-apocalyptic survivors. \\n The world may have ended, but ladies are still there mainly for decoration, reacting with pin-up poses to dire news of betrayal in this dystopian hell. \\n Oh no! My back is going to snap because of my unrealistic proportions! \\n But wait, another incredibly racist stereotype shows up to save the day in the form of a Japanese guy personifying the trope of All Asians Know Martial Arts. \\n Everybody Was Kung-Fu Fighting and it was terrible. \\n Cue more gore, alcoholism, racism, ageism, sexist jokes and then \"happy\" ending. \\n Though not really. \\n Parts! Because she\\'s an object, not a person! Get it? Funny stuff... \\n Well, I guess it is a happy ending because I don\\'t have to go on reading.'),\n",

       "  \"King-size (1). In the context of the Deadpool Classic volumes, this issue was amazing, because you got to see Deadpool's really mediocre origins, then suddenly Joe Kelly came around, and Deadpool rocked. However, within the context of the Omnibus, you open the pages and immediately find what you expected: funny with a little fourth-wall breaking. If anything, it's a little underdeveloped in this first outing, so you have to remember how groundbreaking and revolutionary it was [8/10]. \\n Siryn & Death (2-5). Interesting to be reminded of what story arcs were like in the '90s. These four issues are held together by Siryn and by Wade's health problems, but they also hold together as individual issues, from the fight with Taskmaster to the one with the Hulk. These issues tap down the craziness from the first issue a bit, and so aren't quite as good. The good core of them is Wade relation with Siryn and his moral dilemmas [6+/10] \\n Paradigm Lost (-1). A great historical look at Deadpool: who he was and what he was. It's all the more interesting for the fact that Deadpool only shows up for a single panel! I'm also intrigued by where this story is going! [8/10] \\n Typhoid Mary (6-8 + Annual). This is another story that's brilliant. It actually starts off a little slow, but the Annual offers a major character revelation about the nature of Deadpool, while also giving some important closure to Daredevil, then the final issue in the arc builds on Deadpool's character in interesting ways. So, it's not always about the funny [7+/10]. \\n Deathrap (9). A dull one-off villain and a story that just isn't that amazing [5/10]. \\n The Great Lake Avengers (10-11). The meeting with the GLA that takes up the first issue is fun [7/10], but it's the 64-page issue #11 that's superb which its fun mockery of '60s Spider-Man comics. It's an amazing homage and satire at the same time, just superb [9/10]. \\n Drowning Man (12-14). I've never been that thrilled by T-Ray but the Love Triangle between Deadpool, Siryn, and Mary really comes off well here, and we continue to get lots of great focus on Wade's character. Having some fallout afterward is also nice for such a major confrontation (and it gives other characters a chance to shine, and show how much Wade looks like a monster from the outside, even while seeking redemption). [7/10]. \\n LL&L (15-17). Wow, it's increasingly obvious that Kelly is telling the long (soap operatic) story. This is a great setup, with LL&L being an intriguing organization and the setup for Wade as hero being ... weird. I also loved the Bullseye issue in the middle, which really put Wade's character in perspective [7+/10]. \\n AJAX (A+18-19). The Death annual is one of Deadpool's best stories, both for the great Weapon X backstory and for his relationship with Death herself, something that I'd love to see explored further. The other two issues of this arc are a bit slower because there's so much fighting ... but they've still got a terrific ending. [7+/10]. \\n Wizard Zero. Ugh. Pointless fighting. No plot. Just barely saved from absolute horribility by a little bit of humor [2/10]. \\n Prelude to Dead Reckoning (20-22). This feels like a bunch of water treading before the Dead Reckoning event. Sure, we get some hints of badness in LL&L, and sure we get a preview of Dead Reckoning, but there's also a lot of wasted space. The long casino digression is the worse, but the fight with Cable is also pretty pointless (though it sets up their continuing relationship in later comics [5/10]. \\n Dead Reckoning (23-25). A nice explanation of how all the puzzle pieces fit to date. (Check.) An epic conclusion to the arc. (Check.) Some nice twists along the way to support a surprising ending. (Check.) My only complaint about this arc is that it's too long thanks to the oversized first and last issues [7/10]. \\n A Short (26). The overall plot of these issues is just barely comprehensible. Despite that, the Arabic rescue (26) is quite funny [7/10]. \\n Mercedes (27-30). The introduction of Mercedes offers some nice momentum and mystery for a comic that was drowning in its own absurdity. But, oh, that first issue (#27) with Dr. Bong reveals how Deadpool could really disappear up its own backside. On the other hand, Bullseye (#28) reveals how a better focus on action can meld that absurdity into a real story. Overall, an interesting story for the backstory and character connections, even if absurd Deadpool has gotten old [6/10] \\n The End (31-33). Kelly's writing style has long ago gotten tiring, but this is nonetheless an excellent end to his storyline, explaining Mercedes and who Deadpool is rather magnificently -- and giving even more weight to his heroic arc [7/10]. \\n Baby's First Deadpool. Actual satire, but I really didn't care [1/10]. \\n Pinky Swear (900). Kelly returns years and years later, and this is actually quite a funny story. Maybe his humor is better in short doses rather than in mega-stories [7/10]. \\n Spider-Man. A good use of Deadpool in another title (thanks to Kelly's writing) [6/10]. \\n Overall, these stories are clearly groundbreaking, and definitely funny, but they also get old. It took me over a year to read through the whole omnibus, just because it was more of the same. So, some good stuff here, but it's a pretty dense brick to try and work through.\"),\n",

       "  'see full review @ Katie\\'s Corner \\n I have been postponing writing this review for a long time. Not because I had no idea what to write, but because there was too much I wanted to write about. I even wanted to write more than one review, but somehow every time I had this idea I didn\\'t know where to stop. In essence, there was a great place to stop and write the review, but even when I was reading the book for the 3rd time, it still captivated me too much for me to even stop reading to write the review. I remember the 3rd time I was reading it, that was during the conference in April 2016, I even bailed on my teammates\\' party just so I could experience it once again. So, what\\'s so interesting about it? \\n If this was a video review, I believe I would be talking for at least an hour, but as you have to read it, I\\'ll try to keep it as short as possible, but no promises here. First of all, keep in mind that the story started releasing in 1995 and it was ongoing for a couple of years, well, there are around 28 volumes. Therefore, don\\'t ignore it, if you do not like the art, in the beginning, you\\'ll get used to it. I loved it a lot! There were moments when I wished the author didn\\'t know how to drew dead bodies. But I\\'m going on the topic right now. The story follows a 16-year-old Japanese girl - Yuri. The opening pages are great, and you wonder if the story will happen \"now\", but hat\\'s where I\\'m going to disappoint you, or maybe elate you. Due to some circumstances, Yuri is dragged into the past, specifically in 12 B.C. into Hatti era. In the very beginning, I didn\\'t add everything together, because I learned Hattie\\'s under a bit different name in my history class. Therefore, if you are a fan of historical romance, tonnes of action and battles, politics and court intrigues, get ready for a fantastic rollercoaster called - Red River! \\n Here\\'s another thing you should know, in essence, this was the initial story that made me crave historical romance. It was the reason I read Legend of Basara, Crazy Girl Shin Bia and Legend of Nereid. But let\\'s get back to the story, you can always read the review for others on my blog. As I have mentioned, befoe I have read the story 3 times, and I\\'m pretty sure I will read it once again after some time. Why do I love it so much? It has a strong plot line and fantastic characters. I love reading about storing female characters, and Yuri is just like that! You can argue that she did depend on Kail, but if you look at it, she grew as a character much faster than him. Her charm made even me fall in love with her. My boyfriend is getting jealous, so I\\'ll have to rephrase it. Her wit and her ability to assess the situation very fast made me like her as a character a lot. She has a sense of humour, she\\'s loyal, and she doesn\\'t fear to fight for what she believe is hers. But let me introduce her partner - Kail, sorry I have a selective memory when it comes to his surname. He\\'s a fantastic politician and caring person. Don\\'t get me wrong, but I do make a difference between a politician and person in this story. He falls in love with Yuri unconsciously, and it is a fantastic moment when they finally acknowledge their feelings and overcome most of the barriers on their way to happiness. \\n Another character that needs to be mentioned her is Queen Nakia, or for you to better understand our villain, pretty much for the whole story. There were some others too, but it was ultimately the behind all of it. Her reason and goals are quite normal for an ambitious queen as well as for a queen of that era. I didn\\'t quite get why a Tawananna had a second highest position, even if the king had a wife (that\\'s when Yuri goes in Egypt and meets Nefertiti). Yup, we have a lot of famous historical people appearing in the story and trust me you\\'ll never get bored. There\\'s always something on the way of Kail\\'s and Yuri\\'s happiness, in the beginning, it was Yuri\\'s dream to go back to Japan, it was ... I\\'m actually trying to spoil the best part of the story! Sorry, for that! I don;t really want that. My hand is writing all by itself without me registering anything... are you ready to plunge into 12 century B.C.? don\\'t forget, it\\'s absolutely different from the 21st century. Get to know, how a person\\'s life can change in a matter of seconds. And how will or characters overcome different problems that will arise on their way to ultimate happiness. \\n I remember I read somewhere that leaders are born, but without special circumstances, they might never nurture their full potential. I believe it\\'s the same with Yuri, if she didn\\'t come to the past she would have been just another normal person, but she got to experience a lot of traumas both physical and mental, but will she able to overcome them? That\\'s what I will leave for ou to find out! I believe anyone should read this story. It\\'s not only a romance story. It\\'s a story of true leadership and loyalty.

Therefore, if you are a fan of historical romance, tonnes of action and battles, politics and court intrigues, get ready for a fantastic rollercoaster called - Red River! \\n Here\\'s another thing you should know, in essence, this was the initial story that made me crave historical romance. It was the reason I read Legend of Basara, Crazy Girl Shin Bia and Legend of Nereid. But let\\'s get back to the story, you can always read the review for others on my blog. As I have mentioned, befoe I have read the story 3 times, and I\\'m pretty sure I will read it once again after some time. Why do I love it so much? It has a strong plot line and fantastic characters. I love reading about storing female characters, and Yuri is just like that! You can argue that she did depend on Kail, but if you look at it, she grew as a character much faster than him. Her charm made even me fall in love with her. My boyfriend is getting jealous, so I\\'ll have to rephrase it. Her wit and her ability to assess the situation very fast made me like her as a character a lot. She has a sense of humour, she\\'s loyal, and she doesn\\'t fear to fight for what she believe is hers. But let me introduce her partner - Kail, sorry I have a selective memory when it comes to his surname. He\\'s a fantastic politician and caring person. Don\\'t get me wrong, but I do make a difference between a politician and person in this story. He falls in love with Yuri unconsciously, and it is a fantastic moment when they finally acknowledge their feelings and overcome most of the barriers on their way to happiness. \\n Another character that needs to be mentioned her is Queen Nakia, or for you to better understand our villain, pretty much for the whole story. There were some others too, but it was ultimately the behind all of it. Her reason and goals are quite normal for an ambitious queen as well as for a queen of that era. I didn\\'t quite get why a Tawananna had a second highest position, even if the king had a wife (that\\'s when Yuri goes in Egypt and meets Nefertiti). Yup, we have a lot of famous historical people appearing in the story and trust me you\\'ll never get bored. There\\'s always something on the way of Kail\\'s and Yuri\\'s happiness, in the beginning, it was Yuri\\'s dream to go back to Japan, it was ... I\\'m actually trying to spoil the best part of the story! Sorry, for that! I don;t really want that. My hand is writing all by itself without me registering anything... are you ready to plunge into 12 century B.C.? don\\'t forget, it\\'s absolutely different from the 21st century.

       "  'see full review @ Katie\\'s Corner \\n I have been postponing writing this review for a long time. Not because I had no idea what to write, but because there was too much I wanted to write about. I even wanted to write more than one review, but somehow every time I had this idea I didn\\'t know where to stop. In essence, there was a great place to stop and write the review, but even when I was reading the book for the 3rd time, it still captivated me too much for me to even stop reading to write the review. I remember the 3rd time I was reading it, that was during the conference in April 2016, I even bailed on my teammates\\' party just so I could experience it once again. So, what\\'s so interesting about it? \\n If this was a video review, I believe I would be talking for at least an hour, but as you have to read it, I\\'ll try to keep it as short as possible, but no promises here. First of all, keep in mind that the story started releasing in 1995 and it was ongoing for a couple of years, well, there are around 28 volumes. Therefore, don\\'t ignore it, if you do not like the art, in the beginning, you\\'ll get used to it. I loved it a lot! There were moments when I wished the author didn\\'t know how to drew dead bodies. But I\\'m going on the topic right now. The story follows a 16-year-old Japanese girl - Yuri. The opening pages are great, and you wonder if the story will happen \"now\", but hat\\'s where I\\'m going to disappoint you, or maybe elate you.

       "  'Batman #1 --What an opening sequence! Batman is in Arkham Asyloum putting down an escape of most of his Rogues Gallery, thinking about the answers to the question: \"What is Gotham?\" A sequence that highlights Snyder\\'s greatest strength -- the embracing of symbolism in thought squares. \\n The battle rages until Batman\\'s nemesis joins the fray, then the story is all about his allies. Three of the Robins, Commissioner Gordon, Barbara and others. The art is simply drawn (and faces seem too closely related from one character to another for me), but they are gorgeously coloured, so when the second act bores us with speechifying and the third act bores us with Se7en copy-catting we\\'re still distracted enough by the visuals to go merrily along. Finally there is the inevitable cliffhanger, and all my mid-tale boredom evaporated. \\n First issues of \"reboots\" are notoriously difficult, but I think Scott Snyder did well to strike a balance between the old and the new. Bring on #2, says I.Batman #2 --Our introduction to the assassin who does the job for the Court of Owls -- Talon -- is a beautiful thing. It\\'s hypnotic storytelling that heightens tension and threat, causing me serious edge of the easy chair suspense, but when Snyder adds the weaving of Nightwing (my favourite member of the Bat-Family) to the tapestry of his tale, I am all in. \\n Is it possible? Will the Court of Owls and Talon become my favourite Batman / Nightwing villains? If things continue the way they are headed then the answer must be yes.Batman #3 --We often talk about \"world-building\" when we talk about speculative fiction, generally praising a piece or an author that builds believable worlds. And when we praise these authors the praise is often high praise, but for me there is a higher form of \"world building,\" which deserves even higher praise -- myth building. \\n George Lucas\\' stories aren\\'t great -- at least for me -- because they build a believable Galaxy; his movies are great because they build an effective mythology within that Galaxy. So in this third issue of the Court of Owls, when I realized that Scott Snyder wasn\\'t bothering to build the world (let\\'s face it, the world of Gotham is built) but was, instead, building mythology, giving birth to the myths of Batman, I had a mindgasm. \\n The Court of Owls feels like it has always been. It doesn\\'t feel like the creation of Snyder and Capullo (the artist). It feels like it has been around since the earliest days of Batman, as if the Court has always been in the shadows of Gotham, dictating the happenings of Bruce\\'s world, a myth on the periphery of Batman\\'s history. But it hasn\\'t. It is new. It is the creation of these creators, and this Court is one spooky fucking bunch. They are as creepy as anything or anyone that Batman has ever faced. I want the Court to continue forever.Batman #4 --Explanation. Exposition. Nightwing. A nice lull before the big, big action with Dick around as Bruce\\'s conscience, and a further deepening of the mythology of Gotham and the Wayne family make this a talky but compelling issue. I am unsure about the art of Capullo, however. When he\\'s drawing Talon and the Court I am mesmerized, but everything else lacks for me, so much so that I find myself resisting immersion into Snyder\\'s Gotham. Such a drag.Batman #5 --The Bat Signal burns for a week while Batman wanders the labyrinth of the Court of Owls. He wanders and drinks the water from their fountain and slowly battles madness, and we\\'re brought along with him as the pages go from vertical to horizontal to upside down, and we\\'re treated to symbolism and foreshadowing and call backs and genuine creepiness -- then blood and bursting light bulbs and sadness. And this time Capullo\\'s art, especially in the Gallery of Mad Portraits, is conjuring some chilling magic. Batman #6 --Batman is beaten ... \\n ... Then Capullo channels Dark Knight-era\\'s Frank Miller and Snyder\\'s Batman becomes savage, escaping the labyrinth ... How? You\\'ll have to read it yourself to see.Batman #7 --The arc comes to an end that is the beginning of something much bigger, and Nightwing, our little Richard Grayson, is at the heart of it all. Just as Damian Wayne was born to be an assassin, we now discover that Dick was groomed from childhood to be the arm of the Court of Owls, and that ends up being full of spooky. It\\'s a kick ass sequence, the moment we discover all this, and this seven issue arc stands as one of my all time favourite Batman tales. I don\\'t want it to end, and gloriously, it isn\\'t over yet. \\n Batman #1 --'),\n",

       "  'While I can\\'t say that I shared the intense hatred others felt for this particular book, I would say that it falls into that large category of \"meh\" efforts -- much of After Watchman comes to mind -- which make me wonder why they should exist. It isn\\'t so much that it is particularly, bad, but that isn\\'t to say it is particularly good. \\n For those who don\\'t recall, Morrison wrote a one-off issue, Batman #666, in which we see Batman\\'s son Damian -- this being way back before Morrison, who claims he intended for Damian to suffer his brutal end all along, had let we readers in on that plan -- having grown up and donned his father\\'s mantle (that \"mantle,\" a sort of trench coat inspired version of the iconic costume came in for much ridicule but I was willing to go with it). If Morrison truly knew Damian\\'s fate, this issue proves a fine example of one of the peculiar joy of writing/reading comics: having your cake and eating it too. In a universe -- or multiverse -- rife with what ifs, one can always circle back and rewrite history in an \"alternative timeline.\" \\n That said, the character of adult Damian in Morrison\\'s vision never jived with his youth. Adult Damian admits that he would never be the equal of either Bruce Wayne or Dick Grayson. Putting aside this bit of modesty, Damian always seemed destined to equal or surpass his father. I did enjoy how he spent years plotting \"cheats\" to make up for his supposed deficiency, but I never bought into the idea of a test-tube bred, Batman trained, Al Gul/Wayne hybrid as anything other than excellent, indeed superior. \\n In Andy Kubert\\'s hands, that stray annoyance is magnified into a painful, slow boat into poor story telling and characterization: if Morrison\\'s Damian doesn\\'t quite feel perfectly right, Kubert\\'s Damian (along with several other characters) is just unrecognizable). We see this from the very first pages. Coming upon a bunch of murdered bodies, Damian, formerly emotionless and often murderously cold, begins to weep and wretch. My rule against spoilers makes the extent of Kubert\\'s \"re-imagining\" of these characters to the point of unrecognizable out of bounds, but suffice to say that it goes downhill from there. \\n Beyond this problem, Kubert also displays an problematic habit of withholding information from the reader. Surprises in a story are all to the good. However, when the characters on the page all know something crucial and the reader is told it half way through to give a cheap surprise, that is just poor plotting. \\n I gave a second star, despite all of this, because I thought the art at times excellent. Some of the fight scenes especially stand out (though in a number of places the over-stylized washed out writing makes the text near impossible to decipher). \\n I liked the Damian arc. I thought the character interesting and the reactions he evoked in other characters refreshing. Now that Bucky and Tim Drake are back, we must assume all the dead return in time. To that I can adjust. But warping favorite characters in the service of poorly constructed stories? That\\'s pure amateur hour and a disservice to fans.'),\n",

       "  '\"Rise of the Third Army\" offers exactly the sort action soaked threat to the galaxy (universe?) that fans have come to expect from Geoff Johns over the years. A new enemy, several missing Lanterns (including Hal), one discarded Lantern, and another brand-new Lantern from earth combine with some extraordinary art to again raise the bar for the whole space opera genre. \\n With the release of \"Rise of the Third Army,\" the penultimate installment of Geoff Johns\\' extraordinary long run on Green Lantern, it is worth taking a moment to consider just how much Johns has made that universe his own. Yes, this volume includes work by some other excellent writers (Bedard especially stands out), Johns\\' vision of Green Lantern has so expanded and subsumed this portion of the DC universe that it is hard to imagine it moving beyond his imprint. Indeed, I had a hard time thinking of any writer who proved such a creative force as Johns, taking an entire section of a given universe and making it wholly there own. Folks like Kirby spawned extraordinary visions that reverberated for generations, but they were wholly his creation. Others have remade a given character based on their imagination (such as Frank Miller with Batman and Daredevil). In the end, I came up with two, both on the Marvel side (Claremont and Byrne with their work on X-men that gave rise to the mutant world that at times to make up the lion share of the Marvel Universe and Starlin who reinvented \"cosmic\" Marvel when he took over Warlock). \\n Still, Johns\\' re-invention of the Lantern Universe is audacious for its breadth. Just consider: where once stood one Lantern Corp and Sinestro slinging his yellow ring, we now have Seven Lantern Corps (not counting black and white of course). Then, for each of these corps we have a new mythology within each of these corps we have an army of memorable new characters. Everybody has a favorite. Larfleeze can claim an army of fans. Atrocious has his loyal followers, though I doubt he\\'d pay them much mind. I\\'m a Daxstar man myself (because a cosmically-powered vengeful cat is just plain awesome). Other talented writers have already begun to play in the wide new vistas of this universe and they will doubtless be followed by many more. Either way, readers and writers both will owe Johns a vast debt. Which of course brings us to \"Rise of the Third Army.\" \\n Let\\'s just say from the beginning: \"Rise of the Third Army\" is rife with cosmic action and cosmic danger. Writing about this book without tripping into spoilers is a substantial challenge. I\\'ll do my best. In many ways, \"Rise of the Third Army\" is very much a transitional book, rushing the Green Lantern universe (perhaps now more properly described just as \"The Lantern Universe\") towards the great confrontation to which it has long been building. The Guardians of the Universe, having slipped from being just arrogant into a sticky realm of ethical ambiguity, are now full on villains. \\n Having decided that the recent chaos of the Lantern Wars proves the failure of their second army (the first being the Manhunters), the Guardians decide to raise a third. With this new army the Guardians have identified a chilling \"enemy\" that threatens the universe: free will. Rich irony given what powers their Corp. Only by depriving everyone of freewill do the Guardians believe that they can ensure the safety of the universe. Oh, did I mention that Hal Jordan (and Sinestro) are missing in action, nobody knowing their fate? \\n The actual Third Army consists of these faceless, grey monstrosities that by touch morph any sentient into another of their soulless numbers. The art here does marvelous work, and the designer of the Third Army, Ethan Van Sciver, deserves great credit for conjuring the perfect visual metaphor for the substance of this story. Mouth-less, they cannot speak. Each is the same as the next. As an individual suffers joining their army, we see terror in their eyes. Once joined, those eyes either look enraged or somehow soulless, depending. Gaps on either side of their heads reveal a green glowing brain, willpower nullified into slavery. Perfectly chilling, they allude powerfully to Lovecraft\\'s horrors. \\n If the cosmic threat of the Third Army isn\\'t enough to perk your interest, this volume also gives us Earth\\'s newest Green Lantern, Lebanese American Simon Baz. The debate on Baz as a character will no doubt rage for years to come. For now it shows little sign of cooling. Some fans seem to appreciate the expansion of the DC universe into little-explored corners of our culture. Others will question the idea that Baz is chosen for his ability to overcome \"great cultural fear\" and the fact that his family isn\\'t just suffering under the wave of post-9/11 anti-Arab sentiment - no, Baz is falsely accused of being a terrorist. The whole thing seems more than a little heavy-handed (and I found Baz vs the Justice League silly. Why does the JL become third string yutzes every time a writer feels a whim?). All that said, I will remain a proud member of the minority who isn\\'t bothered by Baz, having discovered the problem of regular recharge, deciding to carry a gun. A gun will likely have little impact on the likes of, say, Atrocitus, I like this clever allusion to why Abin Sur was in that spaceship. \\n As for Baz, he points to a real unanswered question about Johns whole effort in Green Lantern ( a run of which, as you can likely tell, I am a hugevery much a fan) - the need to continually up the cosmic threat ante. Baz, you see, isn\\'t just any Green Lantern - no, as we quickly learn, he\\'s a lantern who can do things with his ring that were previously thought impossible. Not just any lantern, but a lantern on steroids. The same of course is true with Johns\\' vision of the Lantern Universe: each threat is defeated only to be replaced by a still bigger threat. The Sinestro corp is bad. Agent Orange and the Red Lantern Corp are worse. Think that\\'s bad - here comes the Black Lanterns (and yep they\\'re worse still). Several universal crises later, we now face Guardians out to wipe out sentience in the universe with the Third Army, so yep, that\\'s pretty much worse still (and right around the corner, the universal threat of the mysterious First Lantern). This continual swelling of cosmic danger has made for a fun breathless read (and without giving much away, yes, there are still greater threats on the horizon!), but one wonders how long writers will be able to keep this crazy pace. Can\\'t a Green Lantern get a break and just duke it out with Evil Star? \\n For all the great universe destroying threats in this volume, the writers do not neglect two of the Corps most human lanterns - Kyle Rayner and Guy Gardner. I\\'ve always had a soft spot for the former and, without giving anything away, Bedard does excellent work here as part of the \"New Guardians\" Green Lantern title. As for Guy Gardner, he has often unfortunately defaulted into being a one-note character, but talented Peter Tomasi does a fine job filling out his personality and keeping him consistently interesting. As with the multi-titled Bat-verse, the many books of the Lantern-verse can give books like this one a bit of a disjointed feel. Still the threat of the Third Army, with its faceless, spookiness helps to keep these threads, if not tied together, at least proximate enough to remain consistently engrossing. \\n In the end, The Rise of the Third Army suffers just a bit from that sense of it being a transition into the next big conflict. Despite this, it is rip-roaring good read and a testament to the extraordinary expanded universe that Geoff Johns has bestowed on a corp of writers yet to come. I loved Kyle\\'s effort to master the emotional spectrum, especially the heart breaking way he \"masters\" violet. Further, I\\'m a sucker for the range of characters that make up these corps and many receive their due in this book. B\\'dg (a personal favorite!) shows his metal. Salaak again proves himself to be more than a stuffed-shirt. And others... well, as I said, no spoilers. Suffice to say, if you\\'ve loved Johns\\' action drenched work on GL, you need to pick up this book.'),\n",

       "  'A rather magnificent collection of all the Squadron\\'s major appearances. It sometimes cuts off other, connected stories, but this volume is nicely organized, at least telling you the fates of those other stories while the history rolls of the Squadron continue to unroll. \\n Let the Games Begin (Avengers 69-70). The introduction of the Squadron Sinister is magnificent for its cosmic scope, but you also have to love the Avengers of the time, with its close interrelations to other titles and its great characterizations. However, this story is just a building block for an entire universe [8/10]. \\n The World Is Not for Burning (Avengers 85-86). After the introduction of the Sinisters, it\\'s rather peculiar to suddenly see a heroic Squadron Supreme in another dimension. There\\'s little explanation offered, but this is really the start of their saga. Sadly, it\\'s a pretty \"meh\" story: heroes fight, then they fight against a deformed super villain [5+/10]. \\n The Serpent Crown (Avengers 141-144, 147-149). This sequence of issues is a horrible mishmash. It\\'s got Kang, Immortus, a trip to the past, the appearance of Hellcat, two fights against Brand, and a trip to the Squadron Supreme\\'s Earth. Much of that running in parallel. I\\'m not convinced that author Engelhart had any idea of where he was going, and it sort of shows, particularly in the murky connections between the Squadron Supreme and Brand. \\n With that said, it\\'s a wonderful mishmash too. Though they meander and muddle, these stories are epic. First, we get the last Kang story. (Ha!) Then we get the transformation of romance star Patsy Walker into superhero Hellcat. The Brand part of the story falls a bit short, but once we get to the Squadron\\'s Earth we get a rather magnificent story of the Serpent Crown having taken over the whole planet (and the Squadron deciding to fight against it). It foreshadows the magnificent scope that later Squadron Supreme stories would enjoy [7/10]. \\n (The excerpts from the 1989 annuals better explain the plot of these issues, but otherwise aren\\'t that interesting or well-written, and also have a horrible spoiler from the Squadron Supreme miniseries.) \\n Hyperion (Thor 280). A shockingly bad story. I mean, Hyperion comes to Earth to convince the Avengers to film a movie. And then there\\'s a random hero fight, followed by a major coincidence, followed by twin confusion. Agh! The only cool thing here is that Sinister and Supreme Hyperion meet [3/10]. \\n The Overmind (Defenders 112-114). The Squadron Supreme really isn\\'t very good at keeping their world safe, because here they are again, with another evil power having taken over their government. Whoops! This is a wonderfully epic story that feels much cleaner than the Serpent Crown affair. On the downside, it doesn\\'t manage to give much characterization to most of the Squadron. Still, it\\'s a fun story, deeply enmeshed in Defenders lore (including a rather shocking final surprise about Nighthawk) [7+/10] \\n Squadron Supreme. There had been numerous Squadron Supreme appearances before this mini-series, most notably the Serpent Crown and Overmind affairs. However, this was the story that truly turned them into real people, not just secondary characters and not just knockoffs of the JLA (though they continue to wear their Justice League origins on their sleeves). The character studies in this mini-series are wonderful and often full of heart. \\n However, this comic is truly great because it\\'s one of the great superhero deconstructions of the \\'80s, right up there with Miracle Man, The Watchmen, and The Dark Knight. It imagines what heroes would do if they were going to change the world and what they would do if faced with human foibles. So Dr. Spectrum (Green Lantern) is more self-absorbed and selfish than Hal Jordon ever was; Nuke (Firestorm) is actually radioactive and causing the death of his parents; and Tom Thumb (Atom) is unsure of his place in the Squadron. The list goes on. \\n The plot of changing the world is a great one, because it\\'s the sort of thing that superheroes should think of, but it was rarely even considered in earlier Ages. The Squadron Supreme may be the most complete investigation ever of the trope. It\\'s not surprising that it inevitably leads the Fight of the Titans that also seems common in deconstructionist superhero stories of this type ... but Greenwald doesn\\'t pull any punches, and the result is tense and heart breaking. \\n By the time you get done with this mini-series, your mood should be hovering somewhere between awe and the desire to read more [10/10]. \\n Death of a Universe. After the scope and innovation of the Squadron Supreme series, this is somewhat of a disappointment. It\\'s just a fairly normative (albeit well-written) superhero comic. It\\'s great to see the Squad again, and it\\'s great to follow-up on the miniseries just a week later. The artwork is also quite nice here, primarily (I think) due to the coloring. But the character moments are few and far between and there\\'s nothing here that couldn\\'t have happened in the Avengers (or the JLA). Oh, and the problem really is solved by a big (little) deus ex machina [6+/10]. \\n Journey into Mystery (Quasar 13-16+). Interesting to see the Supremes continue with a tight timeline, as this continues straight on from Death of a Universe. Gruenwald gives the Squadron a convincing reason to be stuck on 616 Earth and also does a nice job of revealing the history of the Overmind. But beyond that, this is a somewhat dull comic, especially the last 48-page issue, which is an interminably long fight. The Squadron Supreme also isn\\'t used well as they\\'re (once more) mindless drones for much of the storyline [5/10]. \\n Sacred Geometries (Quasar 51-52). Quasar fights some silly cosmic being. The Squadron appear in the background, still stuck on 616 Earth three years later. [5/10]. \\n Avengers (5-6,A1). Though Hawkeye jokes about it, the first two issues are about the Squadron getting mind-controlled. AGAIN. After that long fight we then get a super long fight against Imus Champion. About the only good thing about these three issues is that after eight years the Squadron is finally sent home! [3/10]. \\n New World Order. It\\'s so nice to have the Squadron back on their proper Earth, and to see their supporting cast and enemies again. But this graphic novel is sadly uninspiring. I mean, it\\'s the government taken over my evil, yet again. And maybe this time it\\'s humanity doing it to itself, rather than being taken over from the outside, but that doesn\\'t make it much less repetitive. Beyond that, the writing is flat: the villainy of the world is over-the-top, the plot is meandering, and the characters are uninteresting [4/10]. \\n Exiles (Exiles 77-78). This crossover falls somewhat flat too. First we get the way-too-typical superheroes fighting, then a court trial that\\'s essentially a clip show. The only good element of the story is that it gives some closure to the Squadron -- but even that feels rushed [5/10]. \\n Ultimate Power (UP 7-9). Though we only get three issues of Ultimate Power, they\\'re the right three issues, as Ultimate Scarlet Witch suddenly brings in the original Squadron Supreme, to allow for even more fighting. Or maybe it\\'s not them, because they just act like clones of the Supreme Power characters. I suppose it\\'s nice this is included from the viewpoint of completeness, but it adds nothing past the stuff in the Exiles issues. \\n Overall, this is a stupendous collection for a very interesting superhero group -- the exact sort of thing that an omnibus can excel at. The early material is great, up to Death of a Universe, but then it sputters out under the weight of less talented authors and less focused stories. The real inheritor of the Squadron Supreme in the later era was JMS\\' Supreme Power ... though that sadly sputtered out too. (But they should also get an omnibus!) In any case, it\\'s great to see all the original Squadron Supreme stories in one place.'),\n",

       "  'Mos Eisley Space Port. You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy. We must be cautious.Actually, Obi-Wan, I found a more wretched hive of scum and villainy some time ago, and it\\'s called the Book of Genesis. \\n Before I detail the scum and villainy that abounds in Western Religion\\'s founding document, let me just add that Genesis isn\\'t even a good story. It contradicts itself repeatedly, its characterization is unappealing, and if it weren\\'t for its historical importance it could not be considered a great work of literature. Still, it is hugely important to our world today, and due its great influence, it is a great book. Now that that\\'s out of my system, here\\'s the scum and villainy: \\n God -- The biggest douche of them all is God. He shows no mercy to Adam and Eve, casting them out of Eden for their disobedience, even though they were tricked by the serpent, which one would assume was also one of God\\'s creations. Then he admits that he botched the creation of man, expressing his \"regret\" for having made them, so his answer is to slay almost everyone and everything -- except Noah and his family and all those animals (I suppose it wouldn\\'t just have been easier to recreate man and get it right the second time). Next, his pride gets wounded, so he babels our languages. Then he wipes out Sodom and Gomorrah (because those folks are evil, don\\'t you know?). Then he calls for male genital mutilation as a proof that the followers of Abraham love him -- not to mention God\\'s demand for the total submission of Abraham be asking the man to sacrifice his son, Isaac (pretty nice of God to let that one slide, though. Whew! Abe\\'s intent was enough). Then he punishes Pharaoh and Abimelech, King of the Philistines because his own followers lied to them. He eventually rewards Jacob, Abraham\\'s grandson, with the title \"Israel\" after his sons slay an entire village because his daughter, Dinah (their sister), fell in love with Hamor and was \"defiled\" in some garden variety love making. Did I mention that God loves slavery? \\n If this cat is up there in the heavens, and I come before him for judgement, I\\'m going to have to challenge him to \"cast the first stone\" if any of my crimes, including disbelief, can even approach the crimes he\\'s committed. \\n Cain -- Murderous clod! Though God bears some responsibility here too. \\n Man -- Before the flood there was human sacrifice (how terrible! I wonder if God remembered that before he had his future chat with Abraham), \"divine beings\" entering human women to make \"heroes\" and a whole bunch of \"perpetual evil.\" Things got better after the flood, though, I am sure. \\n Noah -- Gets pissed to the gills and stumbles around his tent in the nude one night, and poor Ham comes and and sees the spectactle. He tells his brothers, who cover old Noah up, and for his slight, Ham and his son Canaan are cast out, but not before Noah declares that Canaan, his grandson, shall be \"the lowliest of slaves\" to Shem and Japheth. \\n Abraham, nee Abram -- Hmmm ... what can be said about the man who is at the heart of Judaism, Chistianity and Islam? Not much positive. He practices poligamy with Sarah (nee Sarai) and Hagar, he casts out his second wife and first son, Ishmael, at the behest of his first wife. He is willing to slaughter his other son, Isaac, for God. He whores out Sarah to the Pharaoh, starting with a big lie, and leaves Egypt with all the riches of his pimping, and it worked so well the first time he did it again to Abimelech, scoring more land, livestock and slaves for his crimes. And he is the father of all God\\'s kingdoms. I wish I could be rewarded for shit like that. \\n Lot -- Abraham\\'s brother is a lovely guy too. Some of Gods\\' messengers pop into Sodom and Gomorrah just before God rains fire on the cities, and Lot takes them into his house to protect them, but all the big, bad homosexuals show up and want to \"know\" the messengers, so to protect those men, Lot offers up his virgin daughters to the mob instead. Charming. Later, after Lot\\'s wife is turned into a pillar of salt for looking back, Lot hooks up with his daughters and impregnates them, but he was drunk and seduced, so it\\'s all good. \\n Isaac -- What\\'s good for the son must be good for the father, right? So Isaac goes to Abimelech and pulls the same shit Abraham pulled, telling the King of the Philistines that Rebekah is his sister and opening her up to all kinds of suitors. But it pays off and he gets a ton of goodies from the King, just like his Papa. Then Isaac is fooled by Jacob and Rebekah into giving Esau\\'s blessing to the younger son and he isn\\'t able to fix things before he dies. Poor Esau (who might very well be the only good person in the entire sordid book). \\n Jacob -- This guy\\'s one of the worst, so of course he becomes the most beloved of God and attains the name Israel. He cheats Esau. Indentures himself to Laban, then marries both Laban\\'s daughters. Then shags the servants of his wives, Leah and Rachel (at their request, of course). Then he steals away with all of Laban\\'s assets, and God comes down and puts the fear of himself into Laban so that there will be no retaliation. Then he calls on the Hivites to cut off their foreskins to solidify an alliance with him and his family, but his nasty sons go out in the night and kill the Hivites in their beds, so Jacob/Israel flees. Then his son, Reuben, climbs into bed with one of his concubines and becomes hated by his hypocrite father for his actions. And his sons sell their brother Joseph into slavery (except Reuben, who tries to save Joseph), and slaughter the Hivites and are just a nasty crew. Nice child rearing, Jacob/Israel. \\n Joseph -- He of that groovy, multi-coloured coat turns his enslavement to his advantage, rises to freedom, is given control of Rameses\\' Egypt, \"saves\" Egypt and the Egyptians from a seven year famine, but uses his benficence to rob the Egyptians of all their silver, their livestock and their freedom, enslaving them to Pharaoh for all time; meanwhile, he brings his scummy family to Egypt, gives them lush Goshan as a place to stay, lets them care for all the co-opted livestock and doesn\\'t charge them a cent. \\n Yep, Genesis is the most wretched hive of scum and villainy I\\'ve ever seen, and R. Crumb does a magnificent job illustrating the nastiness. The Book of Genesis Illustrated is a great way to tell a poor story of perpetual immorality and despicable entities that just happens to be great. If I was rating the book itself, I would have difficulty giving it any stars, but Crumb deserves significantly more, so the three stars I\\'ve given are entirely his. \\n This deserves to be read, so if you are interested in the Bible or the Torah at all, pick it up. You\\'ll be impressed, I\\'ve no doubt, and maybe even surprised.'),\n",

I will say that the art is really very nice, but ultimately I thought that the overall premise was a bit thin and the storytelling was a bit too scattered. \\n I'm seeing this tendency in middle grade and younger ya comics of thinking that good action and adventure mean that the entire story needs to have a relentlessly, unceasingly frenzied pace. The are times when this legitimately works- Lumberjanes and Moon Girl & Devil Dinosaur are good examples. They feel a bit zany, like the main characters are on a bit of a perma sugarhigh- but I think the difference is that the authors take enough time to develop their characters. I could tell you a host of distinct characteristics about each of the individual characters, characteristics that directly inform their actions and the decisions they make. Ultimately they still feel semi believable as real people with real stories and real motivations, however exaggerated it all may be. \\n Then there are stories like this and, I would say, Disney Kingdom: Seekers of the Weird, which tend to have their characters rushing pell-mell from one crisis to another with very little breathing room for the story to develop. The characters' actions feel almost frantic, and they very often make little sense. The authors tell you some basic, surface level things about their characters, but they don't show you these things naturally throughout the story. \\n Now, I am perhaps being a little unfair to this story; perhaps if I had continued reading some of these issues would have smoothed out, but I just couldn't get up enough interest to finish it (On the other hand, I picked up The Creepy Case Files of Margo Maloo immediately after and had no trouble powering through that in one sitting!).\"),\n",

       "  \"This is another very solid VEI Valliant Universe crossover. Together Armor Hunters and X-O Manowar manage to not just tell a global story, but also provide the backstory of the adversaries, offering up a very balanced epic, which is well supported by Unity. The two mini-series (Bloodshot and Harbinger) are by far the weakest part of the crossover. They're small stories, without the global threat that makes the main series great. Unfortunately, there end up being some hitches in the overall storyline, including an alien that's killed in two different ways (blown up and decapitated) and a giant robot whose combat chronology is a bit confusing. Those oddities and the weaker mini-series keep the overall book from being 5-star, but if you just looked at the three central series, you might still rate things that way. \\n X-O Manowar: Prelude to Armor Hunters. The issues that lead off this volume suggest that X-O is moving toward somewhat more normal superdom, as he takes on tasks for the US government. Despite that, it still has an unusual feel to it, thanks to its heavy science-fiction basis, which I'm continuing to love. I was pretty shocked that the big super-size 25th issue ... doesn't have X-O in it at all. Nonetheless, it was an interesting story, with its intro of the Armor Hunters (and I love the fact that Venditti and Valiant are both willing to do this sort of thing.) [4+ stars] \\n Armor Hunters Mini-Series. The solid heart of the Armor Hunters series, but it's more an X-O Manowar comic than anything else. That means it's got the great characterization that Venditti has been pushing throughout the X-O, but all moved to an even more global stage that the comic has ever seen before, as Aric deals with a menace to the whole world. It's a great comic that continues to show Venditti's strengths (and nicely dovetails into Unity at the end, really showing how well connected the Valiant universe is, which has always been its strength, back to VH1 days). [5 stars] \\n X-O Manowar: Armor Hunters. This isn't really X-O Manowar. Though it appears under that name, 3 of the 4 issues actually cover the backstory of the Armor Hunters, following up on issue #25. And, I love it. This is a wonderful history, really making the antagonists of the crossover into interesting, tragic heroes. (And the final issue coda is a nice hint at things to come). [5 stars] \\n Unity: Armor Hunters. Unity is clearly a subsidiary comic in the Armor Hunters arc, but it stays involved with the big picture items and the evolving story, so it's more successful than the mini-series, which tended to get a little small and specific. Ninjak and Livewire are both put to very good use. Ninjak is depicted as an interesting, multi-faceted character, while Kindt really has fun with Livewire's machine empathy (almost, but not quite, to the point of success). The result is overall a fun read. [4 stars] \\n Armor Hunters: Harbinger. It's good to see Generation Zero again, and Dysart places them in an appropriately horrific apocalyptic environment, creating the opportunity for big-picture heroics. I don't think the resulting story is as great as the main Armor Hunters comics because it doesn't have the same scope and because Generation Zero is too large of a cast to appreciate appropriately. Still, this is an enjoyable miniseries. [3.5 stars] \\n Armor Hunters: Bloodshot. Probably the weakest part of the Armor Hunters crossover. It's mainly a long drawn-out fight with an alien, followed by a long drawn-out fight with an alien. Worse, it's not really depicted that well. Somewhere between the scratchy art and the muddy plotting the major beats of the fight get confused, leaving something that's not as exciting as it should be. Finally, the flashbacks to the South America jungle don't add anything to the narrative; I was never able to figure out what their point was. I think many of the problems may have been due to a either a disconnect between the writer and the artwork or between the artist and the writer ... but even then, there just wasn't a lot of plot here. [3 stars] \\n This Deluxe volume was also very nicely put together (which has been the case for all of VEI's deluxe volumes). Now if Valiant can just be convinced to not reprint the X-O parts of this story in X-O Manowar Deluxe volume 3, all will be well. (Overlapping volumes has been the one problem with their Deluxe program, and here they really have the opportunity to just insert Armor Hunters between X-O Deluxe volumes 2 & 3.)\"),\n",

Where before we\\'d had a serious character-driven comic, suddenly we have a comic action-adventure with horribly cliched dialogue (\"It ... can\\'t ... end ... this way!\") and unbelievable actions (let\\'s assault our guards and escape, after faking a heart attack!). It\\'s also rushed and ends on a note that undercuts the whole series to date, as Kate and Batman go on patrol. Gag! Oh, and half of the art is so cartoony that it works against the style of Batwoman to date (and the style of the other half of this issue). The best I can say for this issue is that is manages to wrap up the plot threads of the previous run. [2/10]. \\n I tried to consider the rest of the volume on its own merits, by putting it away for a couple of days, and thus not having the great development and writing of the previous volumes so clear in my mind. Sadly, that wasn\\'t overall successful. \\n Year Zero (25). I was a bit more satisfied with the writing here, in and off itself, but this is a Year Zero book at its worst, full of unlikely but significant meetings. Very heavy-handed [5/10]. \\n Webs (26-31). At first I thought that Andreyko\\'s first longer arc was just mediocre superhero fare, but then I increasingly realized how tone-deaf it was to Batwoman. Jake is totally dumped from the comic. Kate has serious problems fighting some two-bit costume, and their battles drag on and on. Maggie is dragged into a soap operatic court case. Then, in the middle of a fight in Arkham, the villain opens up all the prison cells, Because that\\'s never been done before. Gah .... Some of this would have been bad in any comic, but the rest is definitely bad for Batwoman [4/10]. \\n Vampires (32-34). This final arc is even more horribly out-of-tune with Batwoman to date. I mean it\\'s become some sort of crappy pseudo-comedy with characters named Killshot and Night-Thief, and there\\'s even an uncomfortable, offensive vampire plot. And of course a godawful stupid reason to break up Mags and Kate that just stinks of editorial mandate. Maybe in another comic this might be OK, but not worth continuing with. Here, it just seems like the author has no idea what he\\'s writing. [4/10]. \\n Overall, this was a bitterly disappointing volume. I mean, I knew Williams and Blackman were gone, but I liked Andreyko\\'s run on Manhunter, so I thought it might be OK. Unfortunately, his writing style is a pretty horrible match for Batwoman, and on top of that, he\\'s not at his best here.

The aesthetic details and colorful costume designs contrasted with mostly dark toned panels are perfect for the bloodbath fight scenes and stealth stories. Tepai Pascual's panels are undeniably great to look at. She is truly an artist. \\n That is where the problem starts. Although admittedly her fine arts undergraduate degree thesis, it is perfectly understandable that the material itself weighs heavily in artwork. But personally, before publishing, one should have created a killer story, right? Maktan 1521 unfortunately settles with good artwork and a shitty story. \\n Please don't get me wrong here but Maktan 1521 is deeply flawed. The story is so generic and sometimes disjointed you cannot root for any of the characters in the story. You can even say that it is a rehashed 300 graphic novel with Shikamaru in it. What I am pointing out is that it is a mash-up of influences and is filled with war movie cliches. It lacks the originality that Lapu-lapu deserves. \\n What is unforgiveable in Maktan 1521 though are the speech bubbles. Very, very horrible speech bubbles. Now, some may cringe on what I have said but some will also understand why. \\n I cannot really not compare this with Mervin Malonzo's Tabi Po. If you get the chance to see both of these and you only have to choose one, always go with Tabi Po. Both are equally beautiful artwise with Pascual winning on action and movement, but Malonzo's style is so original that you'd certainly feel (and smell) history and the past. \\n Tepai Pascual is one of the best artists I have seen in our present local comics industry, partnered with a brilliant storyteller, they may deliver the best stories the graphic novel medium can give.\"),\n",

       "  'What is it about Batman that fascinates us so much? Why do we root for the tormented soul? What does he allow us to do that other superheroes (or the majority of other heroes) don\\'t? Why won\\'t he die? \\n Reading Miller\\'s take on the Dark Knight is a fascinating study in your own expectations and how, as a reader, the myth of the subject can overwhelm what is really there. It is also fascinating because, despite Miller\\'s best efforts, I rooted for the caped crusader again. I want him to live forever. But Frank Miller doesn\\'t. \\n At least, not as Batman was. \\n Because this book is a deconstruction of Batman. \\n Whereas Watchmen is a celebration of the Golden Age of Comics, with a brief touch on the idea that superheroes can make the choices that regular heroes cannot, The Dark Knight Returns is a pointed barb that demands we - as readers - take responsibility for the power we\\'ve given these vigilantes. Miller, along with the illustrative and coloring powers of Klaus Janson and Lynn Varley, has created a Batman who is no better than the villains. Unlike the film adaptations (almost all of which have been influenced by this book in many obvious ways), Batman is not just there as the gel to talk about cool villains; instead, Batman is the focus of this story and suffers from his own psychosis. After all, we are looking at a man who wanted more than revenge. Here was someone who used his parent\\'s murder to cover up his own inner demons; his own sense of justice. This inner drive is what forces the old Batman to get up and take the mantle again. \\n That is, Batman is insane. The difference between his insanity and that of the Joker is that Joker is dedicated to chaos (as is Two-Face, whereas the Mutants are about claiming things for their own, more on them later), and Batman is dedicated to structure. Batman sees the world as a horrible patchwork piece that needs restitching. Bruce Wayne (who, appropriately, only appears in the first of the four parts) needs to destroy the darkness around him to destroy the darkness within him ... but the darkness within him IS him. And that\\'s Miller\\'s thesis: there is no Bruce Wayne, only Batman. Whether there ever was a Bruce Wayne can be debated, but that what exists now is solely Batman cannot be debated. The series opens up with Wayne/Batman locked in his mansion the way Joker, Two-Face and others are locked in Arkham Asylum. Victims of their own madness and forced to play out their game one more time. \\n So an insane 55 year old man has had enough of watching Gotham deteriorate into a giant crime-ridden mess (like that seen at the start of Batman Begins) that is run by a gang known as The Mutants. He ventures out, unable to fight the Batman inside of him (because that Batman IS him, to defeat Batman is to die), and starts to dole out his brand of justice to the city around him. But ten years has passed and society no longer wants a dark vigilante who leaves the \"bad guys\" with broken bones and laid up in hospitals. Not dead - Batman refuses to kill - but close enough that they won\\'t do whatever bad thing they were doing before. \\n The Mutants play an interesting role in this book, not just as the instigator, but also as the constant malleable enemy that Batman would fight when the other major villains were on vacation. The mutants split up when their boss is destroyed. Those who watched Batman defeat their boss take on the mantle of the caped crusader and call themselves Sons of Batman (S.O.B.\\'s ... yes), while others dress up as Nixon or Nazis (with the swastika tattooed on various parts of their body) or whoever will hire them. They become, in essence, the goons for hire that work for our big villains in the movies waiting for their moment. As if there is a criminal element there that lies waiting for Gotham and always is there waiting. In the end, the people themselves take on the role of Mutants - both SOB\\'s and evil - in the riots but claim they didn\\'t know what they were doing. So is Batman wrong to desire this level of justice all the time? \\n The myth of Dark Knight Returns is that it\\'s dark and violent. Well, this myth is much like the myth of the Batman; the criminal element (the readers) must always expect it to be worse than it really is for the man (book) to work. Was it a slap to the face back when first released ... I can only imagine. This was a time when most knew Batman through Adam West, and here Frank Miller ran that image through the ringer to emphasize the psychological pain Batman had and instilled in those around him. But this was not to glorify Batman - or to make it dark/gritty/whatever - but simply to state that such a man could not actually exist in the real world without there being an effect spread to all people around him. The Batman of the 1960\\'s is closer to Superman. The Batman of Dark Knight Returns is a washed up ex-superhero with a vendetta against crime that won\\'t let him stop. Is there violence then? You bet! But is it to the degree that I expected ... no. I heard that there was rape in this book and lots of blood ... well, yes and no. The most offensive things occur off-panel; and the absolute worst is only mentioned after the fact. Batman is the one who bleeds the most in the whole book, and that blood makes an impact because it is used so sparingly. This is violence used to keep us from rooting for violence, and to look at blood and fighting and guns in that way is significantly darker than the fairy tale that most James Bond movies show. \\n So the darkness was due to a paradigm shift, not a tonal shift. The violence was also a part of the story and the paradigm. And this is not entirely clear in the movies that have used Miller\\'s work as inspiration. \\n Batman (1989): Maybe the most successful unison between Adam West and Frank Miller ... this is a Gotham that is crime-ridden and someone must change it. This is a Gotham where the crime is urban and small scale, crime that occurs at night to make the people fear crime. Batman plays on this fear, but there is still a lightness. Why? Because the focus is on Joker, not Batman. \\n Batman Returns, Batman Forever, Batman and Robin: From one of the greatest Batman films spawned this list of movies (that are unevenly successful). What happened? Well, they kept dark sets but put in Adam West as the crusader. Again, the focus is not on Bruce Wayne/Batman. In fact, all three of these have at least 2 villains to examine ... which missed the point of Miller\\'s vision. The villains are a reflection of Batman (as Batman says while staring at Two-Face\\'s whole face in part 1 of the comic), but this is only clear if we focus on Batman and keep the villains as side stories. \\n Batman Begins, The Dark Knight, The Dark Knight Rises: Christopher Nolan tried, he really did. He pulled out many plot points, had a tight story (for the first two anyway) that made the villains an effect of Batman (a theme discussed in Miller\\'s book), rather than the focus of the Batman movies. The aim for realism was also meant in good faith ... but we have a hero to look up to and root still. And here\\'s where darkness for darkness sake doesn\\'t work - Miller was destroying a myth and investigating the worst elements of that hero ... Nolan praises Batman for the work he can do and then gives Wayne a clean slate (ha! like the program!) to live the rest of his life healthy, wealthy and wise. Demons defeated, life is good. Which doesn\\'t deconstruct the mythos of Batman ... it only rebuilds it in a darker town. \\n TL;DR - This is a great book that destroys Batman by examining his flaws. This is not about creating a dark world where tortured souls can come out on top ... this is about creating tortured souls who turn their world dark and wondering why we idolized them in the first place. A classic for good reasons ... though a little too pessimistic for a reread.'),\n",

These first two issues focus on putting a new team together, and they\\'re the fun procedural issues that you only get in a comic like Avengers (or DC\\'s LoSH).

I even like the setup of Simon being the hero after he emerges from 30 days in a sensory deprivation tank. Unfortunately, the story doesn\\'t go much deeper than that.

He is often seen as Batman's opposite: the dark to Batman's light, the crazy to batman's sane, the chaos to Batman's order. But that's not the case, as many great comic book writers have been quick to show us. Batman and Joker, who they are and their actions, are but shadowy reflections of one another, they are too similar to be opposites. They are both dark, both crazy, both chaotic, and if there is any difference at all it is the difference of motivation and what that does to their consciences, which is where Batman manages to separate himself from the Clown Prince of Crime. \\n And it is in the realm of conscience that Dick Grayson plays his fundamental role in the life of Batman. Dick is the Horatio to Bruce's Hamlet. Like Hamlet, Bruce's parent(s) are murdered and his actions from then on are motivated by vengeance. Like Hamlet, Bruce is a prince above the peasantry, a man untouched by the constraints of lesser men. Like Hamlet, Bruce is brilliant, makes connections others can't, and is capable of deep love and emotional pain. Like Hamlet, Bruce needs a Horatio. He needs Dick to be objective when he cannot, needs Dick to criticize his behaviour when others won't, needs Dick to offer opinions when Bruce fails to see something important, needs Dick to protect him from himself. \\n It is Dick who is uncomfortable with Bruce's more brutal moments; it is Dick who is most against Batman's relationship with Catwoman; it is Dick who will receive a request to join the Justice League from his benefactor and have the guts to say no; it is Dick who will step in to maintain the presence of Batman when Bruce is missing; it is Dick, even more than Alfred, who will turn his back on Bruce when he/Batman has gone too far. He'll always come back, sure, but he will stand by his principles even in the face of the man who took him in and made him who he is. \\n So Nightwing was one of the New 52 I was most excited to read. \\n Traps and Trapezes (Vol 1), the first arc of the series by Kyle Higgins & Eddy Barrows (whose pencils are fantastic in this arc), is glorious when it comes to Dick Grayson: it lets Nightwing be Nightwing, lets Dick be Dick, without Batman (at least until the last possible moment in issue #5). The influence of Bruce is all around Dick, of course. But for five issues we get Dick on his own, on his own and dealing with some pretty serious shit. \\n Haly's Circus is back in Gotham, the circus Dick was in as a boy, as one of the Flying Graysons. It is the big top under which his parents fell to their deaths, and Dick finds himself inheriting the circus from a family friend at the same time as he is being hunted -- as himself rather than his alter ego -- by an assassin named Saiko (think a pissy Wolverine-lite). \\n It all builds up to an arc-closing confrontation with Bruce in the Batcave and some serious revelations about what Dick was being groomed for before the death of his parents and his moving in to Wayne Manor. \\n There's nothing groundbreaking about the plot, the action or the dialogue. It's pretty tame stuff, although all those elements have enough quality to do their job. The arc is strong, however, when it comes to character, and that's what matters to me when I am reading a Nightwing comic. If I want deep plots I go to Detective Comics; if I want killer action and dialogue I go to Batman; but if I want to spend some time with the Bat-characters, I go to Nightwing, which is precisely where this arc excelled. We were given a touch of Barbara Gordon, a hint of Bruce and Alfred, and plenty of Dick. \\n And who would turn down plenty of Dick if given half a chance? (sorry ... how could I resist)\"),\n",

       "  'I won this book through the GR first reads program -- very exciting, the first time I\\'ve won one of these! And it arrived pretty quickly, too, which was nice because I needed to read it, review it, and pack it up to move to a new address next week.... \\n This book is the story of Maria, the new girl in a crappy school who was expelled from a fancy Catholic school and is taking that expulsion -- or, more to the point, the horrible things people said to her when she was expelled -- as evidence that she\\'s worthless and unlovable. We don\\'t actually find out why she hit her teacher; Maria doesn\\'t seem to be a very physical person and she never looks like she\\'s restraining any violent urges in this book, even when one of her classmates pushes her down a flight of stairs . She has a paranoid outside\\'s perspective on people that lets her spot the worst in everyone and a cynicism which she expresses by pointing out what she sees, at least until she strikes up a friendship with Yusuke, who manages to be peppy and cheerful and simultaneously more cynical and more hopeful that Maria ever thought to be: \\n Maria: I\\'ve been told that I taint people. So I shouldn\\'t hide how tainted I am. It wouldn\\'t be fair. \\n Yusuke: But no one cares about that. Even if you\\'re really horrible inside, who wants to see it? Everything in the world is better if you frame it right -- your clothes, your makeup, your room, even your lunch. The same goes for getting along with people. \\n And so, in the face of some vicious bullying by her new classmates, Maria decides to give herself one last chance to be \"saved\" by trying out Yusuke\\'s approach of putting a lovely spin on everything. And slowly, over the course of the book, she discovers that she doesn\\'t actually hate everyone in the world, even when she sees their flaws! She even strikes up a budding romance with Yusuke\\'s best friend Shin. This is book 1 of 13, so I imagine things are not going to go smoothly from now on, though. \\n The most interesting thing about Maria, to me, was how focused on herself she is -- in a good, healthy way, I think. She\\'s not trying to be friends with the popular girls or date the popular boys for their own sake; what she wants is to be able to love herself, and she knows that she needs help from other people to learn how to do it. For a lot of teen stories, triumph is either becoming popular or rejecting popularity in favor of something better, and that doesn\\'t seem like it\\'s going to be Maria\\'s story (although, interestingly, it may be Yusuke\\'s).'),\n",

       "  'Several publishers have reprinted the famous \"Dan Dare\" comic strip from Eagle, the British boys\\' weekly from the 1950s and 1960s, but this set of large-format volumes from Hawk Books remains the best. Devised and drawn, in its glory days, by the artist Frank Hampson (1918-1985), \"Dan Dare\" is one of the masterworks of English popular culture, the unfolding story of Colonel Dan Dare of Interplanet Space Fleet, his faithful RAF-style batman Digby, and their unending battle against the dangers and evils which threaten the Earth, most famously in the form of the Mekon, the green, swollen-headed, shrivel-bodied Venusian dictator who hovers above his minions hunched on a sort of personal flying saucer. \\n Yes, it sounds silly, but it\\'s wonderful. \"Dan Dare\" is a work of genius, and I don\\'t use the word lightly. The stories are long, rich and detailed, the characters vividly memorable, and the standard of illustration exceptionally high; no one did spaceships, futuristic cities or alien planets better than Frank Hampson. At its height, in the trilogy \"The Man from Nowhere,\" \"Rogue Planet\" and \"Reign of the Robots\" (Vols. 5, 6 and 7 in the Hawk Books series), \"Dan Dare\" combined compelling science fiction narrative with a sheer visual beauty which is breathtaking. \\n Not the least of its attractions is the sense of character and community that the stories convey. I think of \"Dan Dare\" and think not of spaceships and explosions but of Dan and Digby (Battle of Britain-style hero Dan, said Hampson, was what he had wanted to be in his RAF days; Digby, fat and lazy, was what he feared he was); Spacefleet Controller, Sir Hubert Guest (an illustration of Hampson\\'s father, who literally modelled for the part); of black-bearded naval commander Lex O\\'Malley and red-haired teenage space cadet, \"Flamer\" Spry; of feisty feminist scientist, Professor Jocelyn Peabody; of the Venusian, Sondar; of Lero, the Crypt. Even now, to say over the litany \"Dan, Digby, Lex and Flamer ...\" (repeated endlessly in the continuity recaps for \"Rogue Planet\") fills me with excited anticipation. \\n There is a sadness now in looking back at the old Dan Dare stories, and it\\'s not just the sadness of nostalgia. Since Dare\\'s 1960s demise there have been many attempts to revive him, including an animated television series. Nothing has worked. Hampson was Dare and Dare was Hampson. But that was the trouble. After the publisher of Eagle, Hulton Press, was taken over at the end of the fifties, Hampson\\'s expensive and admittedly obsessive methods of production, involving teams of studio assistants, elaborate scale models, and an arsenal of reference materials to produce two pages of comic-strip art a week, were decreed too expensive. \\n The axe fell. Forced out of the comics industry, and with no share in the Dan Dare copyright, Hampson ended his days as an art teacher in a further education college. His story became a classic and tragic tale of the battle between art and commerce, played out against the unlikely world of the British boys\\' weekly. But art, in the end, is never really defeated. Devotees all over the world remember Frank Hampson. His greatest creation remains a monument to a gifted man who opened the minds of generations of children, everywhere Eagle was read, to adventure, imagination, enchantment. \\n Hampson\\'s story is recounted in detail in Alistair Crompton\\'s biography, The Man Who Drew Tomorrow (1985) and its later update, Frank Hampson: Tomorrow Revisited (2010). Daniel Tartasky\\'s Dan Dare, Pilot of the Future: A Biography (2010) provides a good introduction to Eagle and Dan Dare.'),\n",

       "  \"Reading A.D. Death without any clue what the back story really is got me so confused. I mean, what the heck is happening here? If not with the book's description here in Goodreads, I have no idea that this is a story about humans finding the breakthrough formula in conquering death, hence the title of this three-part series. \\n A.D. After Death at its best is an intriguing take about our species under the premise of being literally immortals. And with Scott Snyder and Jeff Lemire on the reins of the creative chariot, nothing could go wrong. Unfortunately, A.D is very flawed. So intriguing may be a good word to describe this, but I prefer this one: incohesive. \\n For example, there are these panels where our protagonist Jonah is in this some kind of jungle, then suddenly a hentai tentacle plant or something attacked him (and without having known of the plot beforehand, this would pass for a weird alien invasion thing). Of course, there will be some kind of explanation on how this will fit in with the whole story. But that left me more confused than intrigued. For those who have read Trillium, it also felt that Lemire cut those pages out of that book and pasted it in A.D. \\n So our main guy Jonah Cooke who had a tragic past turns out to be a klepto, he stole a cow (named Darwyn, an absolutely awkward tribute to the late Darwyn Cooke) which is vital to the story somehow, then he left the barn or something like that to go into this fututistic-ish mountain town and work in a SETI-like lab with rainbow clouds somehow seen outside the window as a reliever to a woman he seemed to haved loved before but he will forget soon because for f*ck's sake I do not know the side effects of being immortal! That is how vague this book one is! \\n There's even an illustrated story (nope, not a comics) embedded inside. I didn't hate reading it, but it also felt like a lazy take on an otherwise beautifully sad flashback that could have been best told in panels than paragraphs. \\n Snyder's narrative style of beefing the story with mystery and wiki-worthy information just doesn't fit with Lemire's trademark themes on loneliness and separation. These two guys doesn't blend perfectly to tell a convincing tale. They honestly need to deal with their creative differences and come up with a better book two.\"),\n",

       "  \"see full review @ Katie's Corner \\n Today is a usual manga review day and I have a very interesting manga for you. What actually made me start reading it was a quite interesting idea behind the plot. It's not all that new, but its still interesting. What is the idea? Heh, if you haven't read the summary yet, the please listen carefully. Our main character Harusumi Minami (male), dreams of being a princess in the past - Veronica. No, I didn't make a mistake anywhere. To cut the long story short; Harusumi was a princess in his past life and he remembers his past life. Not as if it was yesterday, but he remembers it very well. Strange? You haven't heard all of it! \\n Try to imagine a whole class of such weirdoes, but their memories got triggered because of an incident. And now you have it. Past blending with the present. All of those who reincarnated only want to find answer to one question, as to why there was an assault on princess Veronica's castle and made everyone remember their past lives and for what. We should not forget to add into the chaos of these things the ability to use magic by some of the characters. Now divide all of our characters into 3 or even 4 camps and the only thing there is left is to start a war. Wait they already started it in the latest volumes. Weird and fascinating doesn't describe it anymore. \\n I enjoyed the story a lot, but what made me take off one leaf was nearly no progressing relationship between Harusumi and Yuu. In the latest volumes, they finally started showing that they're actually going out. But well, they didn't have a lot of time for themselves with all the chaos happening around them. It may annoy you, but there are too many talking. And I mean it, too much, even though the intrigues that mostly every character plots are fabulous, there's too much talking. There were moments where I just wanted to jump over it, but then, I would have lost a bulk of new information. \\n The thrill that the author creates is s high as ever, and I don't know about you, but I just have no idea who wither Eugene or Lucas is and that's after reading 11 volumes. There were so many leads, but every time they were leading to nothing. I'm having this weird feeling, that even the author doesn't know who Lucas or Eugene is. Though the latest suspect is still Zeze. I'm not really spoiling anything here. \\n Another thing that might frustrate you a lot, is too many characters. It's only that you have to remember them, but that you have to remember who is who in the past. That can make your mind blow, though at the end of each volume is given a chart, it doesn't help a lot. You can't look there every time. \\n I hope you will find some time and read this great story. I'm not sure if I will do another review about it (it's still ongoing). But nevertheless its really a must read. You'll at least learn how to plot intrigues as Harusumi. He's awesome in every aspect. Stay tuned for more reviews as well as promos.

I was on the verge of dropping it a few times, but nevertheless the story's intrigue was too high for me to drop it. Why did I want to drop it? Well, the answer is very simple and unfortunately it contains a major spoiler, but I will say it nevertheless. As you know there are 31 volumes and 180 chapters and in 179 of those our characters are still elementary school kids, the time is going very slow in the story. We finally see the 16 year old Mikan and Natsume only in the last chapter. Yes, that was the main reason why I was frustrated with the story. It covers so many problems, but because the solvers are 10-11 year olds it's a bit unreal. The love that Mikan has to Natsume and he to her is too unreal for 11-yeal-olds. They truly love each other and trust me, from the part when Mikan leaves whom her parents are I was crying. I had to put away my tablet and compose myself to continue reading. The last 2 volumes are something that I believe everyone should focus their attention. Every emotions come bare, every secret, the author just takes a knife and thrusts it into our hearts. \\n I remember when I finished this story I couldn't fall asleep and truth to be told I couldn't read anything else for several days. All my thoughts were getting back to it. I was getting back and thinking everything over. I believe this is one of the stories that everyone should read. It covers so many human issues that if I start discussing each and every one of them it will take me days maybe even weeks to cover it. \\n All characters are fantastic and we see a lot of theirs development. Some characters stay as villains, but some do covert to a good side and trust me you want to be there to see it. I can say that all of them have left a deep impact on me. I still can't agree to the choices that the principals made in the end. Better to say my mind understands, but my heart doesn't want to acknowledge it. However, the moment when Natsume confessed to Mikan will be I my mind for a long time. I really need to make that list of best ever confessions. I am not a big fan of the whole fate thing, but here I was felt it from the beginning that's why some moments shattered my heart. \\n I hope you will start reading this story. It did take me a long time to read, but I was reading it after 12 and that week was full of projects and exam preparations. In my normal days I would have finished it maybe in 2 full days.

I was on the verge of dropping it a few times, but nevertheless the story's intrigue was too high for me to drop it. Why did I want to drop it? Well, the answer is very simple and unfortunately it contains a major spoiler, but I will say it nevertheless. As you know there are 31 volumes and 180 chapters and in 179 of those our characters are still elementary school kids, the time is going very slow in the story. We finally see the 16 year old Mikan and Natsume only in the last chapter. Yes, that was the main reason why I was frustrated with the story. It covers so many problems, but because the solvers are 10-11 year olds it's a bit unreal. The love that Mikan has to Natsume and he to her is too unreal for 11-yeal-olds. They truly love each other and trust me, from the part when Mikan leaves whom her parents are I was crying. I had to put away my tablet and compose myself to continue reading. The last 2 volumes are something that I believe everyone should focus their attention. Every emotions come bare, every secret, the author just takes a knife and thrusts it into our hearts. \\n I remember when I finished this story I couldn't fall asleep and truth to be told I couldn't read anything else for several days. All my thoughts were getting back to it. I was getting back and thinking everything over. I believe this is one of the stories that everyone should read. It covers so many human issues that if I start discussing each and every one of them it will take me days maybe even weeks to cover it. \\n All characters are fantastic and we see a lot of theirs development. Some characters stay as villains, but some do covert to a good side and trust me you want to be there to see it. I can say that all of them have left a deep impact on me. I still can't agree to the choices that the principals made in the end. Better to say my mind understands, but my heart doesn't want to acknowledge it. However, the moment when Natsume confessed to Mikan will be I my mind for a long time. I really need to make that list of best ever confessions. I am not a big fan of the whole fate thing, but here I was felt it from the beginning that's why some moments shattered my heart. \\n I hope you will start reading this story. It did take me a long time to read, but I was reading it after 12 and that week was full of projects and exam preparations. In my normal days I would have finished it maybe in 2 full days. Are you ready to get to know great characters and also people because of whose ambitions lots of lives were sacrifices and many dreams destroyed.

       "  'This volume collects Len Wein\\'s work pm DC\\'s \"Before Watchmen\" enterprise: Ozymandias, Crimson Corsair, and the Dollar Bill one shot. I\\'ve expressed my strong agnostic feelings about Before Watchmen elsewhere and I feel no need to subject anybody to a rehash here. However, this book gets more wrong than right. Only the fine visuals and especially the presence of Jae Lee\\'s magnificent, perfectly pitched art on Ozymandias saves it from vying for the worst of the whole of \"Before Watchmen.\" \\n Wein\\'s Ozymandias pretty much fulfills every dread prediction of how \"Before Watchmen\" could go wrong. The story adds near nothing of interest to Moore and Gibbons\\' original. Instead we have a long, drawn out rehash. Watchmen covered Ozymandias\\'s origin with great economy; do we really need to follow Adrian as he walks across Asia, trains in the martial arts, and gets that ball of hashish? I think not. Is he a richer character for us knowing his father\\'s profession or seeing him fight Moloch or seeing him exchange blows and verbiage with the Comedian? In \"Watchmen,\" we were supposed to be amazed that he can catch a bullet; isn\\'t that feat less impressive if we know lots of folks have seen Ozymandias jam a gun by throwing a metal pen into the barrel at range? \\n Giving a character a proper treatment must include doing something other than simply spelling out everything readers can already guess at having happened. It must surprise. It must delight. Otherwise, why not just leave it to the readers\\' imaginations? Unfortunately, what we get instead here tends to plod along. What few surprises Wein conjures tend more push this character towards the pedestrian. Adrian Veidt became Ozymandias when he donned a Halloween costume in order to seek vengeance? The collective yawn deafens. \\n As an aside, one has to wonder how Wein thought it a good idea to do this book in Ozymandias\\'s perspective (and as a confessional diary no less!)? One cannot imagine a less reliable narrator than Adrian Veidt or one who is less interesting. We already know his motivations and his story from his perspective; Moore and Gibbons forced us to live it in the original. What more could there be to add? The answer is nothing, save filler that Wein (as Moore\\'s editor) would have been well served to edit out. That Veidt\\'s narrates this long version of his story - to himself! -- minutes after he tells the tale to the corpses of his servants and before Rorschach and company burst in so that he can repeat the same, almost makes the whole thing - you\\'ll pardon the pun - comical. It seems our dear Adrian isn\\'t just loquacious, but masterbative as well. \\n If Ozymandias spins with unrealized potential, \"Crimson Corsair\" evokes a collective head scratch. If you don\\'t recall, Moore wove a pirate comic, \"The Black Freighter,\" into \"Watchmen.\" It served several purposes. It was a work by Max Shea, an artist who disappeared in the larger story. Moore argued, perhaps unpersuasively, that in a world with real masked heroes, readers \"probably wouldn\\'t be at all interested in superhero comics.\" Black Freighter also served as a meta-commentary on the events of \"Watchmen,\" a clever reflection of several characters and an indictment of their actions. In \"Before Watchmen\" Crimson Corsair seems wholly unmoored from the rest of the story, a pirate prequel... well... just because DC was rooting around for possible story ideas. They might just as well - or perhaps more thoughtfully - have done a series looking at the cases of detectives Fine and Bourquin. Or maybe followed the careers of Dr. Long or Doug Roth? It would have been better than this. That said, the art here is again quite lovely and haunting, fitting well with the subject matter. All in all, a fine salute to EC Comics, but it has little meaningful to add to the Watchmen universe. \\n Last but least we have Dollar Bill. Before this, Dollar Bill was known only for dying when his cape got caught in a revolving door (a black gag given a great salute in Pixar\\'s \"The Incredibles\"). Where in Minutemen, Cooke brought minor characters beautifully to the fore, Wein takes a minor uninteresting character and pretty much keeps him uninteresting. Again, the art fits beautifully (though it more evokes the Silver Age than the Golden) with Steve Rude\\'s drawing and Glen Whitmore\\'s coloring again helping make this by far the best looking of the Before Watchmen volumes. Still, the story remains utterly forgettable. Rather than a riff on the Golden Age of comics, Wein gives us a mediocre mock-Golden Age story. \\n Depending on your perspective, \"Before Watchmen\" was either a crass money grab or a brave artistic leap into the dark. Lovely art, however, cannot save this tragically ill-conceived volume.'),\n",

Howeve, after getting back from my friend\\'s place at about 1 a.m. and starting with absolutely different book to read, something clicked in my brain and I said, I want to read this one right now. I started it, and when I finished it, it was already 7 in the morning. \\n Even though this manga was written about 15 years ago and depending that all old mangas have a really specific drawing, this one had a quite modern approach to many facial features. The story is about a girl who has nothing special and then she gets asked to be a model for a group of very extravagant cloths designers. The story has many ideas which are great for teens. It covers that period of our lives when we have no freaking idea as to what we want to do, and everyone is just saying: \"Study, study, study, get into a uni and you\\'ll figure it out\". But what if we do not know what we want to even study? Well, meet our heroine - Yukari, she is just like all of us who did not know what we wanted to do when we were 17 or 18. \\n If you have read at least 2 shoujo mangas, there is a specific patterm. The girl always stays with the very first guy she falls in love with. Well, here\\'s your disappointment. The first time I saw breaking of that pattern in \"Daytime Shooting Star\", but then I read Paradise Kiss and to my utter disappointment she doesn\\'t stay with George. But then here what I tried to think, wasn\\'t he her second love? Then the pattern wasn\\'t broken right? However, the first guy - Tokumori, he only saw her when she got pretty or something. So we can\\'t really say anything. And well even though I like the Yukari and George pair, somehow George was not a really boyfriend material if you ask me. I think I\\'m getting tangled up in my thought. \\n Why I think thus us a good manga? It teaches us, that not all of us know what our dreams are, and that we should not be discouraged by that. We can find them in quite abnormal situations, but my advice to you: If you found something that you like and want to do it your whole life. Try making that dream into a reality, but try not to go overbroad, but be who you are. \\n I hope you will get your own copy and it will give you some insight into a lifestyle of a highschool girl.

I mean for 8 volumes we were looking forward how she ill destroy him and avenge her father and herself, but no, we see a pathetic girl who\\'s in love with him.

I\\'m always comparing smut mangas to either Kanan Minami or Mayu Shinjo\\'s works. It was nothing spectacular. I guess my crushed expectations are because Silver acted as a woman in the end and not as she should have. But if we take that out, it\\'s a pretty normal story of how you may lose everything one day and how an innocent girl can be turned into a person seeking revenge.

Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman are not around to save the day and lesser known heroes fill their shoes. This book has three different storylines that deal with Booster Gold, Batwoman, and the Question and all three storylines will intersect. \\n I have to first say that Greg Cox does a fantastic job with the novelization of the comic books. I am not the most ardent DC follower but I had no problem with the lesser known heroes and villains. During my read I never felt like I was reading comic books. The fight scenes were descriptive and does a terrific job with the characterization. The journey for Renee Montoya is a great arc. \\n The problem with this book is the material from the comic books. It just never completely grabbed me. Even though it kept me interested I never got to the point where I was anticipating what happened next. That being said I was going to give this a higher rating but then I read the last twenty pages. I did not care for the culmination of the Booster Gold storyline. I had no problem with him but his foe. To me, it was silly. Maybe the more serious reader will enjoy it but for the casual reader it missed the mark. \\n I think this novel would be enjoyed much more by the serious readers of this universe.

Pairing Loeb\\'s noir style with gold-standard Jim Lee art, the love child of talents is a comic book buffet of over-the-top action with a healthy serving of mystery. \\n Now just like in the buffet restaurant, every grub demands to be munched because all of them looks so tasty. That\\'s where the problem starts. The reader may be so full that s/he cannot take anymore of the comic food. Batman: Hush is like that. It is tasty to read, but at some point you may lose track of what you are reading because of the sheer amount of things happening in it. The reader is barely given a breather, and what s/he experiences is panel after panel of action and mystery. \\n Not that the Hush storyline doesn\\'t have something good to offer. From Loeb and Lee? No, it has to be good. In fact it is, but there is just too much goodness in it that I wasn\\'t able to absorb everything. By the end of each issue I still have to reread some parts only to understand what really happened or what has developed in the story. I can say that there\\'s two main questions in the book: One, \"Who is Hush?\" and 2. \"Who is behind everything that\\'s happening?\". The mystery unfolds like a much denser version of The Long Halloween coming to a full circle at the very end. \\n The action choreography is undoubtedly Jim Lee. And IMHO, his art is at the forefront of this era of comics. I have nothing against the writing and art individually, though when put together, there is this feeling that the mix isn\\'t entirely organic to create the story it should have become. \\n Yet, I liked Batman: Hush. It is a good go-to comics if you do not have something in mind, just something to read in order to kill time. I feel that it was better to read it in individual issues than as a collected edition. The story doesn\\'t stay in your heart like the Killing Joke or even Under the Red Hood, but just enjoyable enough to be a recommended read.'),\n",

Even without the background of the first volume, the story was easy enough to follow. Faith Erin Hicks rarely disappoints me with her art and stories, and this was no exception. Sort of a political thriller, but also a story about friendship and the importance of striving to do the right thing (even when it's dangerous or difficult). Really excited to read the other volumes in this trilogy and to see where Hicks takes her talents in the future.\"),\n",

       "  'Never have I read such an emotionally satisfying Batman tale. \\n As much as I loved The Dark Knight Returns (and what sixteen year old comic book geek in 1986 didn\\'t?), there is something inaccessible about Frank Miller\\'s Batman that always pushed me two paces to the side. Jeph Loeb\\'s Batman, though, is a different guy. \\n Well, he\\'s the same guy, but Batman Hush invites us into Batman/Bruce in a way I\\'ve never experienced. I can\\'t pin down exactly why, but there are a few possibilities. First, he\\'s physically and emotionally vulnerable in ways I didn\\'t expect. He doesn\\'t just take a beating; he comes as close to death as he\\'s ever come, and it weakens him for every fight he faces for the rest of the comic. He doesn\\'t just care about people around him, he actually falls in love, opens himself to love and embraces the love that was always and already there. The invulnerable Batman and \"Teflon\" Bruce actually come together with a little bit of humanity, and this time around he actually listens to his allies and takes advice. Wow! Second, it could be that, for the first time since the Dark Knight era of Batman dawned, I\\'ve read a story arc that put Batman\\'s need for vengeance at the end of the queue. It still appears, particularly in Batman\\'s umpteenth beating of the Joker, but it doesn\\'t dominate the man, which means it doesn\\'t dominate the story. Third, and maybe most importantly, Batman Hush finally finds a balance between the Dark Knight and the World\\'s Greatest Detective. The two incarnations become one. Sure the mystery is a bit clunky, but Loeb really tries to deliver suspense, offering clues and red herrings like all good mystery writers should, and the cracks in the mystery are mercifully papered over by Jim Lee\\'s stunning pencils. Which leads to number four -- the art. Poison Ivy, Harley Quinn, Catwoman, Lois Lane, Huntress, Oracle, they\\'re all sexy as hell. Nightwing, Robin, Superman, Batman, they all look the part of heroes. Joker, Clayface, Killer Croc, Scarecrow, R\\'as Al Ghul, Two-Face, Riddler, they all have their menace and madness intact. The flashbacks are beautiful, the action is often in motion, literally, the depth of the landscape and even the rain of Gotham is tangible. It is truly a luscious visual experience, and it perfectly captures all of the things Loeb wanted his Batman/Bruce to be. \\n Batman Hush hit every emotional chord in me, and I loved being played. Even Batman\\'s mindfuck victory over the mastermind of the Hush conspiracy was what I wanted it to be. And then Selina Kyle walked away. So perfect. \\n Now, I admit that there are thematically superior Batman tales (most of Miller\\'s work and Alan Moore\\'s unparalleled The Killing Joke come to mind), but Batman Hush is know slouch, and it did everything else very right. For the first time in a long time I could actually see myself choosing a DC title over a Marvel -- that\\'s gotta be worth five stars.'),\n",

       "  'Ah, branding. It\\'s been four years since the Thunderbolts Classic line stumbled to a halt after volume 3. But now Hawkeye is popular, so we get what would have been volume 4, labeled \"Hawkeye & The Thunderbolts\". Of course, this volume misses Hawkeye joining by a couple of issues, and continues pretty directly from the previous volume, so I can\\'t imagine it\\'d be that interesting without it .... Still, I\\'m glad to have my next volume of Thunderbolts Classic. I\\'m hoping for several more! \\n The Masters of Evil (23-25). This was a fun plotline because it allowed the Thunderbolts to go up against villains on a large scale. It ends well here with a final battle against the Masters and Busiek is able to offer a shocking surprising with the identity of the Cowl. A fun finale [7/10]. \\n Lockdown (26). This one-issue focus on Jenkins is superb. It reads like an proto-Astro City comic, and gives a great view of his evolving character [8/10]. \\n Graviton (27-30). By this point, it feels like Busiek is spinning his wheels a bit. It\\'s good to see Graviton back, and although I enjoy the fact that Busiek is slowly evolving his character over his appearances, four issues fighting against him gets dull. Still there are some good subplots concerning the mystery of their new headquarters and Jolt and Charcoal going to school and good subplots about character relations [6/10]. \\n Imperials (31-32). Nice to finally get some focus on Charcoal\\'s Imperials, and to get a backstory that links them to classic Marvel lore. But this is another storyline that focuses on extended & continued fighting [6/10]. \\n Ogres in the Shadows (33). The last Busiek issue cleans up some dangling plotlines by looking into Jolt\\'s skittishness about school and the mystery ghost of Thunderbolt mountain. It\\'s nice to see Busiek writing what he\\'s good at again, instead all the overly long fights! [7+/10] Of course, Busiek still leaves a lot of danglers behind like the identity of the new Citizen V and what\\'s going on with Abe and the new Beetle. \\n A New Author (34-37). When Nicieza takes over he decides to go back to the basics, and that unfortunately means a new fight with the Hulk, which doesn\\'t go all that well, and which isn\\'t that interesting of reading either. Fortunately, Nicieaz\\'s back to basics also involves the return of Abe and the Beetle, and this is a badly-needed plot that had unfortunately spun its wheels during Busiek\\'s last days. Nicieza\\'s one other major plot involves the death of a major character ... and I\\'d find it pretty over-the-top if it weren\\'t obvious there\\'s more story here. \\n Through all of this, Nicieza offers a slightly different style which focuses on the inner monologues of the characters. It\\'s a little jarring when it\\'s used too much in the early issues, but as Nicieza gets his bearings it becomes a nice way to offer some good character studies. \\n Overall, Ncieza\\'s takeover of the series is well done, and promises to keep Thunderbolts a good book continuing forward. [7/10] \\n Hellcat (2000 Annuals). The rescue of Hellcat from Hell and her subsequent adventures are a total digression from the Thunderbolts storyline, but the Thunderbolts side of the crossover is good enough, even if it\\'s all a big manipulation. The Avengers storyline is unfortunately somewhat less interesting, especially when it descends into a long brawl [7/10] \\n Overall, this volume is weaker than some of the previous Thunderbolts volumes. Busiek seems to have told his interesting stories by the end of his run, and it takes Nicieza a few issues to get going. Still, this is a decent enough bridge, and I look forward to what comes next.'),\n",

       "  'Imagine the odds you might have been given a few years ago if you bet that Aquaman would be the comic that folks crowded comic shops to pick up the next issue? Geoff Johns continues to demonstrate his impressive skills - attention to detail, grand imagination, sense of humor - in this fourth volume, \"Aquaman: Death of a King.\" And while some of the magic may be waning, especially when it comes to pacing (a real strength in John\\'s epic Green Lantern run), it still exhibits all the page turning excitement that has made all the previous volumes must reads. \\n The plot here is pure Geoff Johns. Familiar readers will know his story style: Johns likes to go BIG. As with Green Lantern, his work explores and deepens the mythos of books he takes over, often by poking at older ideas that have long become part of a character\\'s history. Here John\\'s pushes into Atlantis\\'s past: why is Aquaman the \"King of the Seven Seas\"? No, it turns out that Aquaman\\'s crown was originally the crown of the seven cities, all of which were thrust beneath the waves by a king of Ancient Atlantis, Atlan, who united the cities and was then overthrown. Each city sank in a different place and the three that survived each found a different path to survive underwater (four are \"lost\" which tells you immediately that they\\'ll soon be found....). Now Atlan, who never died, is back. Despite having near destroyed his kingdom, he still considers it his, and he wants his crown back. \\n Now I think there\\'s a lot to like about this as a story line. Johns\\' ability to expand a character\\'s universe usually entertains. My issue here is more one of execution. Unlike in his creation of the many ring corps in Green Lantern, Atlan doesn\\'t feel well grounded in the story. He just appears as a filler big baddie who can make Aquaman embrace his throne and open up the coming search for those lost cities. This feels like a major missed opportunity, throwing away the creation of a new character by filling his role with a two dimensional \"big bad.\" As it happens, Atlan\\'s back story has the elements of a good character, but its execution is far too quick and the surrounding characters can only be described as two-dimensional if one is feeling particularly charitable. \\n Atlan does give the opportunity for lots of big battle scenes, which are fun, and given the artist some opportunities to create big double paged splashes that are lovely (and the reason I dislike comics in digital formats!). Likewise with the two page art of Aquaman directing sea life and the sweeping views of Atlantis. Yet on the whole, his attributes as a stock villain seem well beneath Johns\\' usual standard. The same is true of one of the other two plots, the one involving a villain named \"The Scavenger\" who goes around in submarines grabbing atlantean technology and for some reason - we never know why...-- is bent on finding and conquering Atlantis. If this sounds to you like a cheap (and Caucasian) Black Manta knockoff, take heart, you are not alone. \\n The one high point of book in terms of storytelling curiously comes from Johns doing what he does best: taking a tired character and breathing in new life. The character is Aquaman\\'s brother, Orm, otherwise known as Ocean Master. While the idea of the brother hankering from the throne has a long and tired pedigree, I rather like Johns\\' ability to make Orm, despite the mass destruction of his invasion of the surface world, still be sympathetic. Perhaps the most interesting looming story in this book is the idea of those who remain loyal to Orm and see him as fundamentally more loyal to Atlantis than Aquaman. Comic historians may also enjoy the slight similarities between the villain Scavenger and the original pre-crisis Ocean Master. \\n Over all this book remains a mixed bag. Still, just for the art and the action, I\\'d give it a thumbs up. I received a copy of this book from DC Comics through Net Galleys in exchange for an honest review.'),\n",

       "  \"This is another of Icon Books' graphic introductions to difficult subjects. In this case, Osborne and graphic artist Van Loon have probably taken on a bit too much - the whole of Eastern philosophy. Nevertheless, this 176-page picture book provides a sufficient overview of Indian, Buddhist and Chinese philosophy that it will act as a useful guide to those aspects of these traditions that you might want to explore further. It provides a basic primer on the underlying cultural attitudes of an East that is likely to become much more obviously equal to the West in economic terms over the next century. \\n At the risk of gross over-simplification, we can see that these three traditions are all going to inform Eastern attitudes for many decades and centuries to come - and perhaps, as they grow and prosper, influence us in the West as much as we have influenced them during the Imperial Age. \\n India is, in my view, a tougher nut for the Western mind to crack. The Westernisation implicit in the British Imperial project seems to have proved less embedded than we might have thought. The rise of an Indian nationalism of the Right is also a commitment to a particular vision of Vedanta that is unlikely to want radical reform of the caste system or the role of women. The whole 'karma' thing might appeal to the Western New Age but it is essentially a conservative model of the universe that is unlikely to appeal to anyone angered by the unresponsiveness or incompetence of their elected Governments. The conservatism of the New Indian Right may come to prove very problematic for Western liberals and especially for British liberals who have to cater for these elements in their own Hindu communities and coalitions. \\n Osborne tries to show that the Eastern traditions have more in common with each other than any do with the West. I, for one, am not entirely persuaded that they are not distinct. The irruption of Buddhism into China was an alien graft from South Asia that, by the time it reached Tibet and Japan, eventually transmuted into something very different in Tibetan Tantra and Zen with their very different philosophical stances. \\n What they do have in common is the lack of any notion of revelation outside the person and the use of texts as learning tools and advisories rather than as the basis for Truth. Much of the dynamism of the West comes from its revolt against the sclerotic belief in single texts (Bible or Koran) being repositories of Truth and so against limitations being put on philosophical investigation, much as small competing states energised technological innovation through near-perpetual warfare. \\n Any Western Right that wants a return to tradition is asking for a return to text-based sclerosis and does not fully understand that Indian, Chinese and European pagan models may not have been very dynamic (based as they were on agrarian societies) but they were far more culturally dynamic than the book-obsessed over-intellectualised learning of the Christian, Jewish and Islamic Middle Ages. \\n In the end, a lot of Western and Eastern philosophy is just dancing around the unknowability of raw existence and around the relationship between things and minds perceiving things in that context. One value of this book is in showing that there is not much that has been thought of in the West that has not appeared in the East - and vice versa. \\n Nevertheless, there are significant differences in 'mentality'. The West has tended to separate out 'science' from 'faith' and to see them in challenging opposition. The West loves struggle because it is creative - its culture is based on intellectual war and on crowing victory from the rooftops before falling to the next challenger. The quintessential Western philosophy is Hegelianism with its thesis facing off an anti-thesis to create a synthesis that becomes a thesis. The Chinese approach is to see things in terms of opposites that must be recognised as being engaged in a permanent struggle. We, in the midst of it all, must be actively engaged in calibrating these forces into a middle way. This is the natural way, the flow of a stream around boulders to the sea. \\n The Chinese, despite the incursion of Buddhism, which eventually beaches in two cultures wary of their great neighbour (Tibet and Japan), have their own internal philosophical yin and yang in the competing but also mutually accommodating traditions of Confucius and the Tao. There is something deeply humane about the original Chinese solution to the problem of organising and living in an agrarian society - family life and the State are ordered in ritual and duty while the individual flows through the vicissitudes of life with an attitude of withdrawal and self-development. \\n The Indians have a similar model but treat, in a more essentialist and less natural way, the individual as preparing himself to be first a functioning part of society and, then, passing on to what may be called a form of living death of contemplation in the hope that the next reincarnation will raise his status in life. Both are philosophies of hopelessness about radical reform or change except towards some kingly or monkish ideal but the Chinese does permit the existence of a private life alongside the public, whereas Indian philosophy (in its ideal form)turns a man into simply the body for a travelling soul. In that sense, to return to the Nietzschean analyses on which we so often fall back, the Chinese way is essentially life-affirming and the Indian way life-negating, with the challenge and irruption of Buddhism being an attempt to moderate negation in one culture only to import it into the other. \\n Fortunately, East Asian cultures, like Western cultures much later, have proved surprisingly resilient in the long run. Tibetan Buddhism, Zen and Neo-Tantra are far removed from Vedanta. But even Vedanta is far from fixed in its thinking. Yet, within its basic framework, its many strands generally remain coherently Indian and different from the West. Yes, there has been some influence from Western methodologies but these have been absorbed and are perhaps now being reversed as Indian nationalism makes it increasingly less difficult to not be overly-submissive to British-inspired modernisation and 'reform'. \\n The Chinese similarly have not allowed the West to decide how they are to think with one major exception for which the ground was prepared by the regrettable but possibly necessary introduction of Neo-Confucian ideas. The cultural strength of China lay in the calibration of Confucian and Taoist thinking but it assumed an agrarian Middle Earth that was not disrupted by international trade, by more innovative invaders and by massive population pressures. The political and economic situation of China was often far from stable. The constant calibration was painful and increasingly ineffective. The arrival of 'foreign' Buddhism in itself is perhaps a sign of stress with Buddhist reincarnation have the same effect on the suffering poor or relatively deprived as Christian Salvation had on a flailing Roman Empire. \\n Neo-Confucianism and Imperial Paganism in the West have much in common functionally but the latter fell before demotic Christianity in a way that Neo-Confucian Order did not before Buddhism. In Europe and the Mediterranean, Christianity and Islam and their texts triumphed but the Chinese traditional order fought back with an assertion of hard-line quasi-textual Confucianism over Taoist withdrawal. On top of this, the second serious collapse of the old order under Western Imperial pressure saw Marxism-Leninism arrive as a useful appropriation by Mao of the nearest invader philosophy available to the traditional Yin-Yang model that was normal to Chinese thought processes - bringing us back to the essentialism of Hegel by the back door. \\n Today, China is two steps away from its traditional and relatively humane model of balancing individualism and nature (the Tao) and public order and duty (Confucius). It has shifted sharply to the Right (authoritarian neo-Confucianism) and then to the 'Left' (a form of social or collectivist Anti-Taoism derived ultimately from Hegel) and it has now settled into a form of Socialist Confucianism that represents a major intellectual, philosophical, cultural and now military and economic challenge to the rest of the world. \\n This leaves us with the question of the effects on the West of all these traditions that have evolved over thousands of years - with Buddhism the relative parvenu alongside the religions of the book. \\n The best of Eastern thought has made an immeasurable contribution to the revival of serious thinking about the West's own inheritance. With the possible exception of the remarkable emergence of Zen in Japan and some aspects of Tantra (at a pinch), none of these traditions of the East can be called existentialist as such: they all, at the end of the day, have some essence of man or society to which they look. However, the sophisticated approaches to Being, Man and Society of Hindu and Tao thinkers in particular have allowed new ways of looking at the world that have worked to build understanding of the possibility of an actually lived existentialism as well as to explore the links between the mind and the body - and with social reality and 'things in the world' - with more data. \\n The Western rebellion against the text became fully radicalised only within the last hundred years and has converged with what might be called the 'religious common sense' findings of the Indian and Chinese sages. It is not that European thinkers are likely to adopt Eastern ways (that is for mystics and New Age types) but that the investigations and techniques of the sages add serious value to the post-modern philosophical questionings of the West - even if the research needs to be mindful that we are looking for diamonds and nuggets of gold in vast masses of ore nade up of Sanskrit obscurity and gnomic Chinese sayings that may mean nothing or everything. \\n At the other extreme of sophistication is the convergence of the creation of the 'new religions', often trying to emulate a pre-text paganism whose records have mostly been destroyed, with the discovery of the pagan reality of modern India and (underneath the modernisation) Tibet, China and Japan. We might add to this the rediscovery of indigenous shamanistic cultures and of African and Latin American folk religions. In a sometimes desperate search to find the true nature of lost Western paganisms - a frenetic process that is scarcely a century old and parallels the very separate process of the discovery of existentialism - the East is a fertile ground for uncovering data that might suggest how we should be thinking if we are to rediscover our 'natural' roots. \\n The first ports of call tend to be tantra, tao and zen because each of these can connect to pre-existing Western concerns. Tantra appeals to the transgressive and rebellious in a highly individualist and non-traditional society (despite being traditionalist par excellence in its own territory). It has developed a role in the 'dark arts' Magickal community, in the benign but shallow waters of New Age sexuality as Neo-Tantra and in the growth of more mainstream Buddhism, with its increasing 'Tibetan' bias, as a middle class response to the need for meaning in a world filled with ennui, powerlessness and anxiety despite apparent prosperity. \\n The Tao has emerged as the basis for new age thinking on health and the environment but has also become an influence by analogy in attempts to reconstruct the Neo-Pagan Heathen Way of Wyrd espoused by Brian Bates, a world in which the cultures of the North Europeans share dragons and shamanistic origins with our Eurasian Chinese brothers. Zen is where new popular thinking merges with the high thought of existentialism and phenomenology. Japanese culture intrigues many Westerners as being both one of the most modern and one of the most culturally coherent in itself. There may even be envy in some quarters at its dynamic purity - Zen is where the East meets the new existentialist concerns of the thinking Westerner who wishes to detach himself from politics and from the frenetic pace of modern media culture, often while working within it. \\n As for the future, Westernised derivatives from the East are unlikely to be of interest to the East itself - the flow is largely from there to here and the flow in the other direction is not 'spiritual' or intellectual but material and technological. They are revolutions within the West for the West that merely intensify its dynamic and innovative individualism and that bring yet more creative chaos, much to the despair of increasingly discredited ruling elites who would dearly like to introduce Augustan order to their crumbling empires. \\n However, Indian Nationalism and Chinese Socialist Confucianism are still relatively sclerotic intellectually. They are still way behind the West in terms of innovation and flexibility so that the real challenge here is whether East or West can live with each other under these conditions of difference. There will be Easterners who want Western freedoms and Westerners who will want to turn the West into a disciplined Enlightenment Fortress analogous to Neo-Confucianist solutions to disorder. There are Easterners who want more Western technology than the West is prepared to hand over and Westerners with a post-imperialist determination to export values into these rising giants. The room for misunderstanding and conflict is large and this little book is a useful primer on why West and East think about things differently - that this matters should not be a matter for debate.\"),\n",

As the story evolves, it is only fitting that everything in it (the writing and the artwork) improves; understandable as this collection was written over the course of about 6 years. Even so, from the start it focuses on the very details that make up the subplots of the best of the zombie genre: human drama. \\n It is not surprising, then, that most of the gore doesn't come into play until the last portion of the first chapter.

Daniel added some freak called the Dollmaker to shake things up, and speaking of Daniel, he is the best Bat-artist (at least in my estimation) working on a Bat-book today.Batman Detective Comics #2Not much detecting happening in this \"Detective\" comic, and it is the detecting that I have always loved about Detective Comics. I have never been a big fan of Batman as Dark Knight, having first loved him as Batman, The World\\'s Greatest Detective. Now, though, he is just NSA Batman, and his Holmesian detection skills are long gone, having been replaced by torture, hyperactive surveillance and luck. \\n Anyways, Bats walks into a trap, meets the Dollmaker, and we see that he\\'s not alone. He is, it seems, the patriarch of a clan of skin peeling and knitting fiends (with one gratuitously-icky hot-naughty nurse. Not a fan of this touch, by the way), and they are all ready to rend the flexh off of Batman\\'s body. \\n So ... Art good. Creepiness okay. Detection nil.

He kicks him in the face and fucks off. Wouldn\\'t it have been cooler by far to have Batman detect something, like the location of the Dollmakers, instead? Maybe even that JitB was missing a tongue before the beating? Your damn right it would have. \\n Oh yeah ... there are multiple Jokers too. Yawn.Batman Detective Comics #4The Dollmaker story comes to a rather abrupt pause. Batman is \"captured\" then fights a bunch of thugs altered to look like Joker, then the shit hits the fan and their is the usual amount of violence is handed out and the Dollmaker escapes, but at least the Penguin is mentioned, so there\\'s a chance for a classic, not-Joker villain for a bit. I\\'m not counting the Dollmaker out, however.Batman Detective Comics #5A short, short issue, this one. Batman protestors -- all sporting Joker masks -- are filling Gotham City\\'s Old Grant Park, which pisses Batman off because he doesn\\'t care about the public opinion that surrounds his \"good works.\" He\\'s too busy breaking up crime. Some masked bad ass shows up ahead of Batman during the crime he is trying to break-up, kills a bunch of gangsters, then slows Batman down and escapes. It starts and it\\'s over, and then we\\'re hanging out with the Penguin for a page at the grand opening of his Iceberg Casino. It is the most skeletal of stop gaps between issues where things actually happen (illness? lateness? I wonder what\\'s to blame.). But there is a short story to fill space, so let\\'s talk about that:Russian Roulette-- \\n This is a nice, tight little tale introducing us to an interesting alliance between Catwoman and Eli Strange, son of Hugo Strange, the great underused villain of Batman past. The art is gritty, scrappy, hard to make out, and generally too intentionally messy to be truly welcoming, but it is effective, and when Catwoman is shedding blood it expresses the killing mood well. I am curious to see how this will link to everything else, but I won\\'t be surprised if there is no link at all.Batman Detective Comics #6Wham!!! Suddenly the story is all complicated and cool, although that short issue last issue could have gone a long way towards cleaning up the mess that is this issue. Too much happens too soon, and before we know it Batman and Bruce\\'s lover, Charlotte, are in a trap. \\n Still, Penguin is busy playing the mastermind, putting a bunch of crimelords and supernaturally talented thugs under his thumb. Meanwhile, some jackpot named Snakeskin and his cycloptic colleague seem to be helping Penguin trap and do away with the Bat, being the hands in Penguin\\'s typicaly hands-off scheming. \\n And there was a little bit of genuine detection going on at the beginning of the story. Unfortunately the detection had already happened and we were only \"told\" about the detection, but it was nice to see a hint of detection that had nothing to do with assault even if it was only narration in three panels. It\\'s something, at least. Batman Detective Comics #7This underwhelming arc comes to a close much too quickly. Too complex for two issues. Once again a lack of any serious detecting by Batman (most of his conclusions this time come from stumbling upon things as they are happening and everything to do with doggedness and nothing to do with intelligence). No emotional core (as there was in New 52\\'s Batman and Batman & Robin). And no clear consequences or conclusions. All of these flaws solidify that this is the worst opening for all of the New 52 Bat-titles, and considering the quality of the others it is a massive let down.'),\n",

I love how we learn about their pasts and how they have just enough feels to offset the overall comedy of the story. But damn, the comedy was on point. If you find sex jokes funny, then you\\'re going to bust out laughing throughout the entire novel. It wasn\\'t even the obvious things that made me laugh the most though. No, it was the little things like that learn to draw comics flyer that said \"you too can learn to draw dick doodles and Batmen\" that had me dying. \\n The ending was great and I can\\'t wait to learn more about the Sex Police. Man, I love Image Comics.'),\n",

       "  'Sometimes, you just wish that Goodreads has more than five stars. This book is one of the super rare reasons why you need more stars than an \"amazing\" rating. Heck, I would not hesitate to give a hundred stars to the Death of the Family to express how deeply amazed I am to this Batman-Joker story. \\n Yes, Death of the Family is that good. I couldn\\'t think of another New 52 story arc better than this. \\n For a long time, we haven\\'t seen the Clown Prince of Crime in the New 52 right after that disgusting face removal he had in the early issues of Detective Comics. It turns out, he was preparing big time, his grand masterpiece for each members of the Bat family and most importantly to his one and only love - Batman (sorry Harley Quinn). \\n The central thesis of the story is that the Joker thinks that Batman has gone soft and weak because of the other bats and birds in his hero gallery. He yearns for a stronger Batman, the one he knew before all other characters popped out. Those were the happy days for him. Just him and the Batman. So he devised and executed this overly complicated plan that would hopefully result to the death of the family, hence the arc title. \\n This Batman is really screwed-up because his version of the Joker is downright crazy and has an absolute twisted-yet-brilliant brain. His introduction was perfect. The spine-tingling scene in GCPD really caught me. I genuinely got scared of this guy. That set the mood for the story. And my fear for Joker gradually increased as I read the issues, many thanks to Capullo\\'s immensely great artwork. \\n THIS. \\n This Death of the Family has to be a definitive story in some way. Something that answers the question: which Batman story should I read if ____. Like for a definitive Joker (sort of) origin, read The Killing Joke. For a deifnitive Batman detective story, read The Long Halloween. For a definitive story about Batman with its back broken by an absolute brute in a lucha libre mask, read I don\\'t know, Knightfall maybe? So what is Death of the Family? It is a love story. It is the definitive answer to the question: which Batman book should I read if I like to have a i-depth study of the Batman-Joker relationship? You may argue about that since the Killing Joke may answer this too, but man, don\\'t deny the sheer entertainment you have experienced reading in DotF. \\n Death of the Family is the very reason why I love Batman. He\\'s not just a billionaire gadget guy who broods over his city and fights street crooks. He is both a man and a legend. He can be hurt a lot through his family yet the name and the cape still stands up to fight until the end. He cares for other people. Thank you Joker, for being the reason why Batman shows who he is and the best he is. \\n Oh before I forgot, I love how Scott Snyder conjures a sort of hierarchy of the main Bat-villains. That is also exactly how I would rank them, if there is such a thing. But for me, nobody tops the Joker as the best villain. \\n Snyder absolutely kills it. He knows the characters and he can create the best story out of their personalities, what makes them themselves. Capullo on the other hand is a monster. What he is doing in the series is godlike.'),\n",

       "  'When a comic store discussion kicks up about Mike Grell\\'s GreenArrow: The Longbow Hunters, there is an almost religious hush that settles on the speakers as they stand around the stacks or lean against the glass display cases. There is a sort of mythic reverence these nerd acolytes try to pass on to the uninitiated, and having once been one of the latter, I myself was personally touched by the former. \\n Due to a peculiarity in me, however, I didn\\'t take my copy home and devour it with a born-again religious fervour. I did take it home, that much is true, but as I am wont to do with most things other folks revere, I couldn\\'t bring myself to start. Instead, The Longbow Hunters joined my bedside stack of things to read, then daunted me from that vantage. It took me years to finally pick it up and see what all that love was about. \\n I understand the reverence now even if I don\\'t feel it myself. \\n The Longbow Hunters came out between DC\\'s two granddaddy examples of comic book seriousness. Sandwiched between The Dark Knight Returns (1986) and The Killing Joke (1988), The Longbow Hunters features mature incarnations of Oliver Queen and Dinah Lance (stripped of her Black Canary persona), as they love one another, ponder parenthood (and the decision on this is particularly fascinating), come to accept their place as \"super-heroes,\" and put their lives on the line for what they believe. Beyond their somewhat comfortable world, a sort of Jack-the-Ripper serial killer is slaughtering prostitutes, while a second bowman is taking out a series of seemingly unconnected, rich, powerful victims, and a plague of drug crime is polluting the streets the two love so much. \\n In the midst of all this gritty chaos is a favourite of all Green Arrow fans -- Shado. She is a Yakuza assassin, forced to kill a series of targets to regain her family\\'s honour and pay off her blood debt, and her presence forces Green Arrow to consider his own ethics, and embrace the killing of foes. It is never clear if this acceptance of killing is due to a need for justice or a recognition of vengeance as a motivation, but both concepts are possible, and the lack of resolution is one of the story\\'s great strengths. \\n The Longbow Hunters is a strong story. It is beautifully illustrated (brutally illustrated in some parts) intelligently conceived and plotted, and the dialogue mostly holds up for our contemporary audiences. It also goes some distance towards making Green Arrow a serious hero in the DC Universe, and it is a pivotal moment in what would be Green Arrow\\'s finest years as a solo hero and a member of the Justice League. \\n Unfortunately, though, Green Arrow has never been and will never be as beloved as his fellow from Gotham City, so this comic will never have the readership the comics that include the BatFamily command. I think, ultimately, it is this underdog status that makes it such a religious experience for the nerdy followers of DC. If they know the The Longbow Hunters, if they\\'ve read it and appreciated it, if they can pass on their specialized knowledge to others, if they can proselytize their fervour for this high quality, nearly forgotten brother to the granddaddies, they can hold a tiny little niche of the comic book experience that makes them belong, makes them feel special, makes them safe in a world that they feel hates them. And that may just be The Longbow Hunters greatest accomplishment, maintaining a safe space within which to geek out. \\n I am glad I finally pulled it out of my stacks and gave it a read. It\\'s not my favourite, but anything with Shado, especially Shado at her best, is a comic for me.'),\n",

       "  'Relic (21-24 + Annual.) So, we have a new author. What does he bring? On the good side, he immediately hits us with a heavier science-fiction focus than we usually see in Green Lantern: a relic from the previous universe! How cool is that? On the bad side, said Relic is said to be so powerful that the Green Lantern Corps can\\'t defeat it! How dull is that? Way too many of super hero comics focus on super-powerful villains that can\\'t be defeated until the MacGuffin is found, and so the plot hasn\\'t gotten very old and stale. \\n Unfortunately, as is so often the case in the Nu52, the Relic story quickly descends into semi-comprehensibility, because DC seems to think that people prefer to read all of a title\\'s issues, not full crossovers, and so once more we get a horribly incomplete story. It\\'s actually better than most, as one can sort of make out what\\'s going on, but it\\'s still bad. \\n I also have some severe qualms with what I think is the central concept of the crossover -- that the energy wielders are destroying the universe. It\\'s like that horrible Star Trek: The Next Generation episode that revealed that the universe was being destroyed by ships going warp 9. Like that episode, this idea will soon be forgotten (or else \"fixed\"). In any case, I think turning the heroes of these comics into villains who are destroying the universe by wielding their rings is a pretty bad choice, even if it creates some short-term possibility for good stories. (But maybe I misunderstood the whole idea, since I just got a fragmentary story.) \\n The Rest (25-27). The later stories again have a nice science-fiction vibe to them, but I didn\\'t find either particularly enthralling. They were both wordy and prone to dissolve into fights, which wasn\\'t that interesting. I also have a hard time believing the Kyle/Carol romance that\\'s being played up in these issues. \\n Overall, I have to say \"meh\" for this new direction, and that\\'s even without considering how problematic this volume is because of the fact that it doesn\\'t bother to tell a coherent story. (3-stars for the writing herein, but only 2-stars for how the volume is put together, to give you a very incomplete reading experience.)'),\n",

       "  \"Four years ago, DC broke their universe. They rebooted most (but not all) of their continuity, deaging all of their characters by ten years. But, it was a slap-dash story, dropped in at the last minute, and none of their editors or authors seemed to be on the same page to what it meant. So on the one hand we had a continuity that was hopelessly snarled from day one, and on the other hand we had the jettisoning of numerous characters, histories, and relationships. \\n It sucked. \\n Rebirth is, perhaps, an attempt to make things right again. But, it's not really obvious what's going on yet. Is the Nu52 universe a parallel dimension to the classic DC universe? Is it a newly created universe? Is it the classic universe that's been mucked with? It's not clear, and it's not even clear if all of the DC editors and authors are on the same page this time, as Johns seems to already be retconning some of the recent hints at the old universe, such as the appearance of the classic Superman and Lois. \\n This muddiness hints at another problem: a serious lack of plot. The whole issue is a somewhat obnoxious (but well-written) walk through the Nu52 that's all about Wally West trying again and again (and again!) to reassert himself in the new universe. It feels like four chapters of treading water. If you look at it from the plot point of view, it's a dull story. \\n Where this comic succeeds is instead in its promise. Could it bring back the best of the old? Could it create a new storyline that will keep the DC Universe an interesting place for the next few years? Could it do a neat job of incorporating yet more classic heroes into the DC Universe? (The Nu52 did a pretty horrible job of bringing in the Wildstorm heroes, but if you look back to the '80s, DC did a great job of bringing in the Charlton heroes, and in the '70s they somewhat successfully incorporated the Marvel Family / Shazam continuity.) \\n I dunno. This comic is so far a commitment, not an actuality. It has potential. But, I remember that Johns was one of the trifecta who actually broke things in the first place when he helped to designed the poorly considered Nu52 trainwreck. So, I have to wait and see.\"),\n",

       "  'There is a little over a decade of comic book writing I need to catch up on. I loved comics and collected religiously from my early teens to my mid-twenties, then I drifted away from comics for a long time. Only now, now that my kids are discovering comics, have I found my way back to this world I love so deeply, and now that I am back in comic book land, I get to come to fantastic works I missed out on the first time around. Enter Superman: Birthright. \\n With the possible exceptions of Batman, Spider-Man and the Hulk, Superman has the most well known origin story. Even those who\\'ve never read a comic or seen a superhero movie are likely to know the origin of Superman. They know he is the last son of Krypton (even if they\\'ve never heard of Jor-el). They know he was adopted by a childless farming couple in the American prairies (even if they don\\'t know it\\'s in Smallville, Iowa). They know that he goes to the big city and hides his alien identity behind a pair of glasses and a bumbling demeanour (even if they don\\'t know he is a jornalist named Clark Kent and that the city is Metropolis). They know he is the most powerful being on Earth. \\n We all know these things because it has been told and retold countless times, in comics, in cartoons, in multiple movies, in multiple television shows, in dime-store novels; we know these things because they have become the target of satire or criticism or celebration in sit-coms, comedies, plays, academic theses and even literary works. \\n So with that level of cultural saturation -- a saturation that goes well beyond the comic nerd sphere of influence -- how in the Multiverse can anything new be brought to the generative myth of Superman? Much to my surprise, very easily and with excellence. \\n The key is in the recognition, which has since become an integral part of Superman\\'s existence, that no one on Earth would be too pleased with a sublimely powerful, indestructible alien wandering around doing good deeds. Superman / Clark Kent / Kal-el is simply not welcome around these parts. No matter how much good he does, he can be either a potential enemy to us all or an unwelcome deus ex machina who can only make our decisions -- even our destructive decisions -- meaningless because he has the potential to correct them and save us, against our will, from ourselves. \\n It seems like a small thing, perhaps, but it is far removed from the dazzling Superman, the perfectly good and beloved Superman, the completely accepted Superman, who existed from his creation to the Christopher Reeve films and beyond. He was the Superman that only the \"bad guys\" would fear because if you were a good guy you\\'d have nothing to fear from the Last Son of Krypton. But that\\'s not the world we live in now. We live in a world of chronic xenophobia, paranoia and insecurity, and there is nothing secure about a super-alien who can do damn near anything. \\n In Birthright, Mark Waid recognizes the truth about Superman\\'s near omnipotence, and he expresses it through the two most important human men in Superman\\'s life: Pa Kent and Lex Luthor. The former tries to warn Superman of humanity\\'s fears and convince his son to stay hidden and avoid conflict. The latter embodies humanity\\'s paranoia, only ramped up to the levels that only a mad ultra-genius could attain, putting Luthor in a position to make a power grab using the best possible tool -- Superman himself. \\n Details of Luthor\\'s power grab aside, Pa winds up being correct, and the world is not happy about the rise of Superman, even less so when Lex Luthor\\'s plans come to fruition, and nothing Superman does to thwart Luthor\\'s plans for domination can overcome the damage done to his own trustworthiness at the hands of his greatest enemy (a man/boy with whom Clark Kent was once a friend). \\n It\\'s powerful, it\\'s refreshing, and it leads seamlessly into this summer\\'s newest expression of the Superman origin in the Man of Steel. We\\'ve heard Kevin Costner\\'s Pa telling Clark that maybe he should have let others die to remain hidden. Some have been appalled by that idea, but the idea was Waid\\'s and for a legion of comic book fans who prefer to have their superheroes in a world like our own, it is an embracing of verisimilitude that will make Superman relevant once again. And no matter how good the movie is, Birthright already exists and has done the job for nerds everywhere. \\n Yep ... we\\'ll always have Birthright, but wouldn\\'t it be wonderful if Man of Steel was excellent too?.'),\n",

The second is that were-people (half-human, half-animal) are not thought as people at all and are used as slaves. Why did I write these two stereotypes here? you might have guessed that Nakaba is no ordinary princess, she has red hair and her guardian - Loki is a were-person. Because of that nobody acknowledges either of them and many want to kill Nakaba, mostly, her newly acquired relatives. There are many secrets of origin of both Nakaba and Loki, but if I spill at least one, I will spoil the enjoyment of this manga. And I don\\'t really want to be accused of that.

We got to see quite a lot of flashbacks but, if the flashbacks are annoying, here they are just right on spot.

When you read the manga to the end you may say that such ending was not good and that it is not a happy ending at all, however, that\\'s what I thought in the beginning, but when I read the story second time I saw that only this way the story would have been complete and only this way the happy ending was achieved. \\n Dawn of the Arcana is an amazing story, which covers many aspects of human nature. It has love, hate, friendship, hardships, and a lot of adventure and a bit of philosophy in it. It makes you think out of your box, look around yourself and see similarities between the world portrayed by the author and the world around us.

       "  'see full review @ Katie\\'s Corner \\n I suppose everyone knows what your own room is. Well, for about 18 years I didn\\'t have a room you could call my own, so when I started university and moved out to live alone I got this amazing room of mine. What a person would first do? I guess, put some favourite band posters or something like that. Well, that\\'s what I thought I would do, but no, for a year the walls were bare. Why I\\'m talking about my walls? Because \"Dawn of the Arcana\" made me want to put some pictures on my walls. If you walk into my bedroom now, it\\'s full of screen shots of my favourite mangas and around 40% of them are from \"Dawn of the Arcana\". \\n I can say that it is one of my favourite mangas on this day. I\\'ve read for a quite a lot of times, and it never lost its impact on me. You may think that it is not that interesting after you uncovered all the secrets and you know what is going to happen next. Well, for some it may be like that, but not for me in this specific case. Every time I read it, it is as if I\\'m reading for the first time. The intrigue is still there and I find something that I\\'ve missed before and that makes me extremely happy that I found something new. \\n If you\\'ve read the summary, you should know that it is a story of a young girl called Nakaba, well, she is a princess and in order to achieve peace she has to marry the prince of the neighboring country Caesar. In the world that we are now, there are two major stereotypes. First one is that all royal family members have black hair and that red hair is a trait of the lowest class. The second is that were-people (half-human, half-animal) are not thought as people at all and are used as slaves. Why did I write these two stereotypes here? you might have guessed that Nakaba is no ordinary princess, she has red hair and her guardian - Loki is a were-person. Because of that nobody acknowledges either of them and many want to kill Nakaba, mostly, her newly acquired relatives. There are many secrets of origin of both Nakaba and Loki, but if I spill at least one, I will spoil the enjoyment of this manga. And I don\\'t really want to be accused of that. I will just say that those secrets will make you cry a lot and exclaim: \"I kinda knew it\". \\n Through the manga we can see a lot of characters development, especially Caesar. And if in the beginning you just tolerate Caesar because he is handsome, some chapters after you are cheering on him full force and shouting insults on other guys. We got to see quite a lot of flashbacks but, if the flashbacks are annoying, here they are just right on spot. We experience nearly every character to the fullest and even bad characters get to have some good points. When you read the manga to the end you may say that such ending was not good and that it is not a happy ending at all, however, that\\'s what I thought in the beginning, but when I read the story second time I saw that only this way the story would have been complete and only this way the happy ending was achieved. \\n Dawn of the Arcana is an amazing story, which covers many aspects of human nature.

       "  \"Stories: 5 stars \\n Art: 5 stars \\n An illustrated short story collection, much like Lost & Found by this same creator. It's really not a graphic novel, though other reviewers have categorized it as such, because the art is not sequential and, even more importantly, the art is used to enhance the stories rather then to tell the stories. Even though the art is used to augment, it is an essential part of this book. Shaun Tan's work defies our current system of classification in the same way that Brian Selznick and Lauren Redness do. I really love that publishing constraints do not hold him back. \\n In this collection, both the stories and the art are weird and wonderful. They provoke thought and imagination. They make me want to read them again and again. So however you classify this book, I think it's safe to say that it is highly successful. \\n Something else unusual about Shaun Tan's work is its appeal to all ages. Most books that say they are for all ages are really not. The Graveyard Book, for instance, claims to be a book for all ages, but it is really a children's book; most adult readers I know have no interest in reading it, even if they are Neil Gaiman fans, unless they are children's literature enthusiasts. While Shaun Tan's books are classified as children's books, they can easily be enjoyed by teens and adults as well. The reading experience may not be the same, but someone of any age can get something out of this book.\"),\n",

       "  'I\\'m not sure how I feel about Brian Michael Bendis. I dig his dialogue, and he handles action well, but there seems to be an underlying lust for military that rubs me the wrong way, particularly when it informs characters I love, altering them in fundamental ways. Yet that seeming lust for military models makes perfect sense in the state of the contemporary Marvel Universe, reflecting as it does our own reality, so perhaps it is an unfair criticism. \\n Besides, whatever the reason, Bendis\\' engagement with the military model brought Ares (not a namesake but the actual Greek God of War) into the Avengers fold, and this Mighty Avengers arc is my first experience with the Greek badass. \\n Initiative is interesting enough. Hank Pym\\'s longtime personal monster, Ultron, is back and using modern computing to take over and inhabit the body of the newly cybernetic Tony Stark, who Ultron morphs into the spitting image of Janet van Dyne, the Wasp -- albeit in a shiny, nude, silver metal form. And then Ultron comes within a whisker of taking over everything and ending the superfluous presence of humanity. It\\'s the Sci-Fi AI nightmare nearly fulfilled. The action is fast and furious; Ultron is properly logical and ruthless; Hank and Janet spar as they should; Ms. Marvel is full of new leader angst; Wonder Man runs around doing his Fall Guy act; Black Widow is properly useless in the face of a \"super\"-threat, and it is nice to be without Tony Stark\\'s ego for a while. \\n It\\'s Ares, though, who made this comic worth reading for me. Of course, the Avengers beat Ultron in the last gasp, but it is the God of War who comes up with the winning plan and pulls it off. While everyone else is trying to come up with high-tech answers or are simply pummelling the ultimate robot (or absorbing the blast of a nuclear warhead. Nice job, Ms. Marvel!), it\\'s Ares who figures out his own little Trojan Horse ruse. He has Pym shrink him to a cellular level, loads himself with an ancient, Commodore 64 virus, a virus Ultron will have no defence against, and flies right down Ultron/Stark/van Dyne\\'s throat to deliver the virus into Ultron\\'s brain. \\n He battles Stark\\'s cyberdefenses, now nearly perfected by Ultron, and finally plants the virus. Wasp shrinks and saves him, pulling the Axe-Weilding One free of Ultron\\'s death throws, and somehow Tony Stark\\'s systems put him all back together. Yay! Ares wins the day. \\n So why do I like this? Well, when the story starts, Ares seems like a bit of twit. He\\'s certainly sexist, borderline psychotic (one of the Avengers describes him as a cross between Thor and Wolverine), bad tempered, and fairly dismissive of humanity, and his team mates don\\'t seem to have any faith in his abilities, which all leads to a great moment when his plan and victory have come to fruition: those around him are properly thrilled by his tactical genius, and he dismisses their praise by reminding them that he is \"The God of War.\" Exactly. \\n That moment raises my enjoyment of the whole arc, but ... hey ... I am easy to please. Still not sure about Bendis, though. I don\\'t know if I\\'ll ever be, but his work on Initiative was fun enough to keep me coming back for more. For now.'),\n",

       "  \"While I wasn't in the whole fan girl club surrounding the Lunar Chronicles, I enjoyed it enough to want to follow up with it when I heard there was going to be a graphic novel spin-off. I wasn't sure what to expect. I didn't have super high expectations, but I wasn't thinking this would be a total flop. What I got was definitely a different, yet surprisingly pleasant, experience. \\n Wires and Nerve follows the lovely and very charismatic android, Iko. Iko sets out on a mission to rid Earth of the remaining wolf-hybrid soldiers that ignored the call to come back. While on the mission, Iko has a 'come to the light' moment and starts questioning who she is as an android and why she is starting to feel things she never felt before. She is also confronted with the fact that the world is extremely narrow-minded and views her as simply a computer with a personality chip and nothing more. \\n Iko was probably my favorite character from the Lunar Chronicles. She was funny, outgoing, loyal, and so filled with personality and spunk that she just jumped out of the book. It was a lot of fun to be able to dig deeper and really see Iko shine. \\n It did take a little while to adjust to the graphic novel format. Partly because a lot - almost all - of the characters were nothing like I pictured them in my head. This wasn't the fault of the author or even the artist, but it had a bit of a disorienting effect on me. It wore off as I continued to read and got comfortable with the characters, but the first part was a bit of a shock to the system. \\n There was a lot that I enjoyed in Wires and Nerve, but there was a lot that didn't feel right to me. I'll start with what I loved. \\n I loved the way it seemed like an effortless transition from the books to the graphic novel. Some time has passed, but not a lot. It can sometimes be difficult for books to make this transition, but I think Wires and Nerve did an excellent job. There were plot elements that carried over from the series, yet it felt like it was its own story. \\n That leads me to one of the downsides - the time spent reliving the past. There seemed to be a lot of time spent reminding readers about what happened in the series of books. This happens in books and it isn't such a big deal, but there was limited time in the graphic novel. It was frustrating to spend so much time looking back and having so many reminders about what happened as opposed to focusing on moving forward. \\n While other characters, Cinder, Kai, Cress, Thorne, Scarlet, Kinney, Wolf and Winter, are a part of the story, they are pretty much background characters. Cress and Thorne do play a considerable role in the novel, as does Winter and Kinney, but the other characters have very brief camo appearances in the book. In a way it felt like some of these characters (Kai) were just shoved into the novel to give them an appearance and it didn't really fit with the story. \\n That leads me to my other issue - Thorne. Thorne and Iko were probably my favorite characters in the Lunar Chronicles. Iko is kept the same, but Thorne seems to have had a huge character/personality change. In the novel he came across as cocky, confident and just a character I enjoyed. That changed in Wires and Nerve. In this graphic novel he just doesn't feel right. He feels emo-ish, whiney, or pouty or something. I can't put my finger on it. \\n Overall, I think it was a well done graphic novel. I wasn't super in love with it, but it was enjoyable. I really think super fans of the series will enjoy seeing their beloved characters brought to life in graphic novel format. However, I think there is a potential for disappointment. Readers going into the novel expecting another Lunar novel could face disappointment. The novel, due to its main focus on Iko, has a very different vibe to it and while there is danger, there isn't the sense of impending doom and urgency that was present in Lunar Chronicle books. \\n In the end, I was satisfied. It took a while to adjust to the visual representation of characters and even the detailed drawings of actual places, but once that settled down, I was able to enjoy the story. I do look forward to seeing more of Iko and watching her grow as a character.\"),\n",

       "  \"Immortals who have lived through the historical eras of the world is an intriguing concept ... and it feels like Rucka does about the least interesting thing possible with the concept: his immortals are mercenaries who run around and kill people and can't be killed. \\n The actual plot is a bit stronger than that premise, as it's about people finding out about the immortals, which could be a major turning point for their story. Maybe it still will be here. But here it just turns into a kill-fest with characters who are mostly undimensional. \\n With all that said, Rucka does write exciting action-adventure, but I'd be more excited if I thought there were any chance of the immortals losing. \\n I also find the artwork pretty ugly. \\n I'm likely to pick up another volume, but this book still hasn't grabbed me.\"),\n",

       "  \"Nice to finally get all of these Casey stories in a handsome collection, and to see X-Men stories that are contemporary with the Morrison run! \\n Playing God (394). A fair start for Casey. It shows that he has a handle on the characters (though he won't be using most of the ones in this issue long-term) and is willing to move in some innovative directions [7/10]. \\n Poptopia (395-398). Overall, a pretty great comic for its focus on Chambers' desire for acceptance and its willingness to hit hard on the bigotry-against-mutants theme that was just about to disappear (with M day). Casey's take on the X-Men here also continues to be slightly off of the traditional fare: it's edgier and more SF, which is all around a nice match to what Morrison was doing [7+/10]. \\n The Church of Humanity (399-400). The idea of a mutant whore house is just the sort of weird intermixture of the real and the super that Casey loves, and it comes across well here [8/10]. Unfortunately, the 400th issue that finishes off the plotline is too decompressed and thus doesn't hold up the storyline, in large part due to piles of fighting [6+/10]. \\n Absolute Progeny (A2001). I'm not sure what I think of the art (which was artistic, but hard to follow) or the sideways story. However, the plotline really goes hand-in-hand with the scientific take on mutants than Morrison was writing at the time, so this feels like a good piece of the whole [7/10]. \\n X-Corps (401-407). This arc is a little slow to start, but it turns out to be Casey's best to date. It's interesting to see him mixing WildCATS ideas of superheroic corporations with the X-Men mythos. Beyond that, he does a great job of bringing in antagonists and creating an exciting situation rapidly spiraling out of control [7+/10]. The coda with Kurt really doubting his place in the world is an excellent character piece [8/10]. \\n The Finale (408-409). These last couple of issues, with Angel leading things as the head of his corporation, suggest a really nice continuing storyline for an X-Men spinoff, so it's too bad things got cut off (and that feels *very* sudden). [7/10] \\n Overall, I was thrilled to finally get to read this entire run of Casey X-Men. It's definitely a good addition to the mythology. Unfortunately, Casey never seemed to be given to get the opportunity to get his feet under him. There was a big change after 394, presumably when Morrison made it clear what characters he wanted, then 395-400 felt like Morrison's SF X-Men, and 401-409 offered Casey's own take on corporate X-Men ... but there was never a chance for it all to gel. A long Morrison-like run or (even better) a long corporate run without the back and forth of this volume, would easily have come in at 5 stars.\"),\n",

Missed opportunity. \\n Second issue led up to being more about the first because of a symbol seen in both, but it was just an excuse to be a bigger fight amongst many in a pit arena situation. Janey pretends she actually cares about racism. \\n Third issue started with just some random diner because Janey needed a guy to eat (again, pretends like she cares about being a vigilante, but not really). Had a really gross moment where a really fat lady puts her own face in a fry vat and melts it off. I did laugh at the drawings for the semi-feral kids. This leads into a unclimatic chicken processing plant and somehow the guy knows what she is. Another missed opportunity. He and his lackeys killed by zombie chickens. \\n Last issue somehow she detours across the country because she somehow mysteriously loses her book and it ends up in ...Detroit?? after having been in AZ. Makes no sense. This was a decent issue though, she feels bad for the kid because of her past, he betrays her and comes to a messy end. This issue was actually pretty good. Ends with her taking a dirt nap going into the next volume. Which, I find out are not really arcs just collections of issues. \\n The problem with the series is that it's contradictory and nothing is ongoing. One minute she acts like it matters who she kills (abusers, racists, womanizers, etc) and then next thing she kills some random innocent for absolutely no reason. I already mentioned all the missed opportunities. More or less gratuitous blood and guts and tits and ass. Also, this is the fastest volume I may have ever read. There was very little dialogue in most of it, apart from a section of the final issue.\"),\n",

       "  \"For those keeping up with trends in science fiction, Wool by Hugh Howey probably sounds familiar. The lengthy novel was an instant smash hit among readers. The book's success prompted Jet City Comics to endorse a graphic novel adaptation. Though good, the graphic novel does not completely live up to the standard set by the book. \\n Adapted by writers Jimmy Palmiotti and Justin Gray, Wool takes place in a dystopian future where mankind is struggling to survive after the apocalypse. The world outside the human colony is terrifying and dangerous, so much so that even the thought of venturing out is punishable by exile. \\n The narrative of the graphic novel follows the book pretty closely, and as a fan of the book I definitely appreciate that. Discussion of the plot is a little difficult, however, because part of the charm of Howey's writing is the constant plot twists. You never know what to expect, which makes both the book and the graphic novel adaptation a page-turner. \\n The art by Jimmy Broxton reminds me a lot of Lazarus, in that it was good but nothing really stood out as amazing--just really consistent. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, as it makes the overall aesthetic of the graphic novel really pleasing. \\n However, there were a couple of things that were lost in translation. Since the original novel is so long, the adaptation felt a little rushed in comparison. I was also a little disappointed that the characters all looked a little white-washed and didn't reflect the full racial diversity I had imaged when reading the book. \\n I would definitely recommend this adaptation if you're a fan of the book. If you haven't read the book, then I'd recommend checking that out instead of picking up the graphic novel. \\n Cross posted from The Other Press\"),\n",

       "  \"It's been a long time since I've had a freshly unread Fables trade and I was really looking forward to reading this. Sadly it wasn't all that great, but just good enough to keep me interested in reading this series (when I can get them from the library). \\n Flycatcher -- always a bumbling, comical sort of character -- has just realized that he was a prince in the Homelands and that his family was killed horribly. After the spirit of Lancelot (which had been hanging around Fabletown all this time -- who knew?) is freed, he helps Fly don magical armor and take Excalibur into the Homelands to take on The Adversary. The good guys win. \\n I really liked the idea of this story -- it just, you know, wasn't that good. Turning Fly into a brave and noble prince was a nice move, but we never really got to see the transition. There was also never a lick of danger or risk to be felt in Fly's confrontations with the legions of the Adversary's forces. Rather, a feeling of inevitability carried the forces of good to victory, dealing a massive blow against the Adversary. \\n Y'know, it seems like the Adversary has had his ass handed to him so many times in this series, each defeat more crushing than the last, that he's stopped looking like much of a threat! And now the Fables have been stockpiling modern conventional weapons for the shooting war that takes place in the next trade, so they drop a couple A-bombs on him and that's that, right? I mean, it seems like that's where this is headed. \\n Point, Jack: point. \\n The point is, this series has always worked best when it focuses on the lives of the Fables, rather than on the conflict with the Adversary, because the Fables always win their battles too handily. If Willingham wants me to keep reading, he better raise the stakes something fierce in the next storyline.\"),\n",

       "  \"This book is a MESS. \\n Start with the characters. Putting the Earth-2 heroes front and foremost feels like a big mistake, and one of the villains explains why: they're just copies of the universe's first heroes. They make the whole crossover seem small and unimportant. But, Convergence doesn't even stick with that decision. Suddenly the Nu52 heroes are the core of the story, then suddenly classic heroes are. There's no rhyme or reason, and it badly fractures the story. \\n Move on to the plots.They're a problem from the start because Convergence clumsily tries to leverage some recent DC events. I believe the Superman in issue #0 comes out of a fight with Brainiac in Doomed. (But it's never mentioned again, so who cares?) I'm more certain that the Earth-2 heroes of issue #1 come out of Earth 2: World's End. But, I haven't read either series, and there's no attempt to make these events make sense, so they get Convergence off on the wrong foot as a mess from the start. \\n It's fitting, because the core conceit of the series itself don't make much more sense. What, there's some cities fighting? We'll use that as a chaotic backdrop that turns the story into a muddled mess. And maybe the appearance of Nu and classic heroes toward the end of the book is the result of that civic clash, but I have no idea, because it's not explained. \\n The smaller plot points internal to the series aren't any better. Why does Brainiac suddenly change his name to Telos? Wait, he's actually a planet? Wait, he's some guy? Wait, his name is important? But we never learn it? Why is the JSA suddenly attacking Skartaris? Why are they suddenly trusting some guy named Deimos who suddenly becomes a big deal? What's up with the real Brainiac being imprisoned somehow? How is the classic multiverse suddenly recreated when the whole point was that these cities were from doomed universes? \\n (Overall, the rotating bad guys are another serious problem. Even after the comic, I have no idea who Deimos or Telos really is, and their movements in an out of villainhood make little sense because they're so undercharacterized.) \\n In the end, I just don't even know how to explain the badness of this book. Amateur comic writer? Plot points by committee? Last minute ascension of a bad story in a misguided (and failed) attempt to show up Secret Wars? Last minute swerve to rebuild DC's history because of the failure of the Nu52? (Not unlike the last minute decision to create the Nu52 out of Flashpoint.) \\n I dunno, but it failed. Hard. Not worth reading. I wasted my time doing so.\"),\n",

       "  'More often than not Dark Knight Returns is considered one of the greatest graphic novels -- if not the greatest. I can\\'t deny its importance to the form (and to the myth of Batman -- responsible as it is for Bruce Wayne\\'s shift into the \"Dark Knight\" era), but having taught it a handful of times and read it for \"pleasure\" a few more (this reading having been prompted by Christopher Nolan\\'s disappointing trilogy capper, The Dark Knight Rises) I feel that it is a vastly overrated work. \\n And Frank Miller is delusional. \\n In fact, I will go so far as to suggest that we\\'re damn lucky Frank Miller can express himself in words and pictures (and get rich doing it) because if he couldn\\'t express himself artistically (or was a failed artist like a certain Viennese painter), I\\'d put money on him walking into a theatre or a Sikh temple or a political round table and opening fire. \\n The Dark Knight Returns is an ugly manifesto for vigilantism; it is the mad nightmare of a right wing kook who sees the world in ways that it simply isn\\'t; it is an apologia for the first strike; it offers chaos and evil and calls it anarchy without any understanding of what anarchy is; it is a jingoistic, Soviet-era piece of Cold War propaganda; it is an attempt to rationalize violence as the proper response to violence; it attempts to reinforce the myth that a \"good man\" (or country?) can do bad things to bad people and the act cannot, therefore, be bad; yet it offers the tools to undermine and deconstruct the delusions of its author with what seems to be total obliviousness. \\n There is no depth to the characters in this book. Batman is an ugly thug, a giant meat head, a bludgeon, a nasty beast of a man who revels in the torture and maiming of the \"evil\" denizens of Gotham. He\\'s the ultimate rich bully, the bully who gets away with his bullying -- even today in our hyper-aware bullying police state -- the bully whose bullying is \"okay\" because it is targeted at other bullies or because the bully is too beautiful and rich and popular to really be a bully. Miller\\'s Dark Knight isn\\'t complex in any way -- certainly not in the way many of his antecedents have achieved. He is ugly and nothing more. His parents died violently, so he became a weapon against criminals. It\\'s as shallow as it is simple. \\n Miller also gives us the shabbiest expression of Superman ever to hit the comics. Just like the Batman, there\\'s no complexity to the Man of Steel. He\\'s a Boy Scout who follows the law and does what he\\'s told by his leaders, so he\\'s a target for Miller\\'s ham-fisted criticism. Miller tells us Superman is weak and less than Batman because he can\\'t do what must be done the way Batman can. Superman doesn\\'t torture and maim; Superman doesn\\'t kill; hence, Superman is a pussy. \\n I closed the cover of this book moments before I started writing this review, and I can tell you that it\\'s been a long time since I\\'ve felt so disgusted by the work of an author. It gets worse for me each time I read this, but like a moth banging into a window I can\\'t stop returning to this, trying to see what I miss that everyone else sees. My disgust gets worse each time I read it, yet I can\\'t stop my examination of how this nasty tale could have led to our fascination with The Dark Knight. How could an idea that has had some truly excellent manifestations (such as Nolan\\'s Batman Begins or Jeph Loeb\\'s Batman Hush) come from such awful source material? How can people like this book? What the hell am I missing? It\\'s a mystery that only the World\\'s Greatest Detective could solve. Too bad he was nowhere to be found in The Dark Knight Returns.'),\n",

Well, it has my favourite themes: Shinobi (ninja) and time slips. Yes, yes, you've heard me tight. There are that ninjas, similar to Naruto ones (if anyone watched that anime you'll know what I'm talking about). The time slips are two-way: present to past and present to future. Surely, mostly we were in the past and not only one era, but also different ones. \\n The plot of the story is very nice and the great characters make this manga even more amazing. Not only two main - Beni and Kagetora are what make the story, but also two others - Rihito and Hitaki. Now let me just briefly say their relationship to each other. Kagetora and Hitaki are ninjas from the past who time slipped to the present. Kagetora became Beni's bodyguard because of some circumstances, while Hitaki Rihito's. While Beni is in love with Kagetora, and that love is mutual, Rihito is her fiance and he is also in love with her. Did I just unintentionally spoil some good stuff? I don't think so; just stating their relationship is not enough. The way their relationships progress, that's what, really is worth reading about. \\n How do I explain this; this story is amazing whichever way to read it. I loved reading about all characters. Every one of them is broken and only another one can fill them up. Each of them has a heartbreaking story to tell and if you listen closely you will understand each character if not you'll miss the essential part of them. I suppose the hardest impact on me had Rihito. In the beginning he acts as the villain, but as soon as you look into his story, your impression of his changes cordially. It's not pity, but maybe it is pity that you are feeling towards him. However, you're looking forward when he will open the door of his cage and fly. That moment when he has to jump though the whole is the one that makes your heart beat fast, because you get it, soon he's going to change and you want to witness him breaking his chains. \\n This manga has a lot of life situations and wen you unravel all the secrets and understand why each character was like he and she was acting, you cry. The ending leaves a question as to why only Hitaki was there, but that may be a story for a new serialization. This manga has a bit of specific humor. You may not get all the jokes, because they are mostly due to playing of words. However, where I was reading the translators explained every joke and made it simple to understand. \\n I hope you will get some time to read this great story. You will like it a lot.

The ending leaves a question as to why only Hitaki was there, but that may be a story for a new serialization. This manga has a bit of specific humor. You may not get all the jokes, because they are mostly due to playing of words. However, where I was reading the translators explained every joke and made it simple to understand. \\n I hope you will get some time to read this great story. You will like it a lot. It has everything: love, joy, sorrow, betrayal, action and a lot of mystery. Enjoy it to its fullest\"),\n",

       "  \"This should have got three stars as a bog standard basic introduction to the semiologist, Roland Barthes, but the graphics really do let it down and graphics are an essential element in this series which sells itself on using imagery to help get across complex ideas. The fact that Barthes was a sort of philosopher not only of language but of images makes this weakness doubly embarrassing. \\n And why is it so poor - other than looking as if it were little more than scribbles on a page? Because of a strange obsession with penises and sex that the artist, Ann Course, seems to have. \\n There is a natural point where sex comes into play but the interest here seems unnecessarily obsessive - not only in the insistence of five pages devoted to illustrating De Sade's range of perversity and the images of the homosexual Barthes buggering people but the repeated motif of willies on nearly every page in the first half, not a few of them clearly erect if clothed. Fine, nothing wrong with willies but the pictures and a strange leitmotif of a robot like creature with eyes on stalks add absolutely nothing to the argument. \\n The textual argument itself is fine as far as it goes (it is basically an hour's lecture) - though clearly Philip Thody isn't entirely convinced by his own subject, something which becomes fairly clear by the end. The truth is that Barthes is a bit of a one-trick pony, fashionable in his day, but a foot note in intellectual history. Perhaps he will always have to be read by anyone curious about the shenanigans of the post-war French Left Bank and, yes, he adds his bit to the general sense of cynical libertarianism that was part of the culture of the Generation of 68 but, no, he does not really say anything that others have not said better. \\n The flaw in post-structuralism is the obvious one - the great, 'so what?' that it inspires. We are living in a world of codes and significations - so what? Humans need narrative and codes and significations to create narrative - so what? Do the post-structuralists posit truth? or just expose lies? \\n And then it hits you - these people are just Gallic moralists with their visceral and unfair hatred of the 'bourgeois' and often silly (and soon dropped) adulation of the masses. There is no consideration of the human right to be self-deluded as a means of psychic survival in a dangerous world nor of the fact that the deluded and the aware are to be found in all walks of life regardless of their relationship to the means of production. Willing suspension of belief or, indeed, of disbelief is how we get along - observe the hysteria over Obama in recent weeks. \\n And as for Barthes' 'obsession' - that we can be artistically moved by the non-existent. Again, so what? Diana's funeral is a great 'movement' of this sort and some lost themselves in the nonsense (which is their right) while others saw through it and chose to stay silent so as not to hurt the feelings of the insanely sentimental. But we did not need post-structuralists to tell us what was going on? We knew it or we chose subconsciously not to know it - that is what being human is all about. \\n The knowers are not morally superior to the deluded - just different and with a rightful caution about what happens when the deluded capture the State and other forms of power over the undeluded. Fortunately one set of deluded usually dislikes the pretensions of the others enough to enable some degree of protection for those who can see the bones beneath the skin of society and culture. \\n In the end, we are left with another case of intellectuals discovering the bleeding obvious and then packaging it for a career. The squabbles between intellectuals in France in the 1970s about Racine seem to be mere repetitions in style (though not in content) of those between Catholics and Jansenists and not much better than that between the monks whose fisticuffs in Jerusalem are reported today (November 9th, 2008) - futile grandstanding between egos and tribes. So much intellectual effort to so little purpose ...\"),\n",

       "  'To give credit where credit is due, Marvel Legacy #1 is an easy and enjoyable read, keeping things on the safe side of the story and promising to bring back things that has been lost like its other brother DC in its earlier DC Universe Rebirth. But its lackluster narrative and flawed marketing make this initiative more of a cash grab lure than a genuinely empathizing comics fans desperately yearn for these recent years. \\n Can Marvel just let us readers breath and cherish the moment first before bombarding us with a ton of Legacy comics? \\n It is impossibly hard not to compare Legacy with Rebirth, for both stories aim for the same things like addressing the ramifications of the not-so-good things these two comics giants have done over the recent years and turn them all into good ones (diversity, killing-off characters, neglecting others, those types of things) that would hopefully bring old and new readers alike into believing into comics again. But if there\\'s one thing Legacy falls short of, it is emotion. DC Rebirth is so full of it I cried the first few times reading it. Legacy on the other hand brings excitement and promise but felt bland in comparison. Sure there are things that a reader should be very, very excited about in Legacy, but that \"cliffhanger\" feeling is not that special, just the same with other interesting comic book teases. \\n It is good to see a couple of illustrators lashing out their artistic talent here, but consistency is my biggest issue. Esad Ribic\\'s kind and subdued drawings (which I do love by the way) do not really mesh up nicely with other art styles. For an event this big, they clearly should have addressed this one. \\n Marvel Legacy is one big tease for what Marvel comics has to offer. This I can definitely say is not a line-wide reboot, but an initiative that makes Marvel pull itself up by its own bootstrap. But man, I don\\'t think i can keep up with this publisher\\'s marketing campaign. Can they just let the readers breath and cherish the moment first before bombarding them with a ton of Legacy comics? Take it easy, Marvel. \\n After a barrage of event misfires, Marvel Legacy finally makes their universe more interesting and engaging with promises and reveals that will hopefully turn into good stories but it does not succeed in bringing the heart and greatness in what they can truly offer.'),\n",

This first one came out in 1976. \\n I might have had my expectations set too high, because I wasn't much impressed. The whole thing seemed like it didn't know if it should be jokey or serious. It had a bit of a mix, but it was kind of like a poor cartoon. It actually reminded me a lot of old Mad comics in a way. Partially from the illustration style, but also from some of the writing. \\n Valerian (and eventually Laureline) go back in time to 1986 (10 years future to when the book was written) to NYC post glacial melting. The city is filled with pirates and brigands, but their directive is to take out an evil scientist [?] Xombul. I'm not really entirely sure why. He went back in time to wreak havoc or something. Valerian is a bit oafish, but kind of like James Bond. Maybe he's more Austin Powers, gets by more on luck than actual wit? Laureline is the real MVP here, but she has little part in the book at the same time. They get captured and escape and captured and escape and again captured and escape. The bad guys are clearly as incompetent as the good guys. \\n The illustration style is cartoony, but passable. Sometimes the panels (and therefore the characters and scenery) get really small. The writing is a lot more wordy than modern comics, telling instead of showing (or rather both). \\n I'd give another volume a chance, but to me it seemed more like schlock than anything. I have read that the writing and illustration evolved over time and I can only assume it gets better but I'm not in a hurry to keep going.\"),\n",

       "  'The only thing more entertaining than this book are the negative reviews of this book! \\n I\\'ve always been a fan of Batman. Why? Because he\\'s not Superman. He\\'s darker. He\\'s badder. He\\'s an anti-hero superhero. \\n I recently discovered that Batman has had a history of abusive behaviour towards Robin. On my quest to hunt down all images I could find of Batman smacking Robin around or otherwise being a jerk to him I stumbled on to \"All Star Batman and Robin\". A ha, thought I, if anything has Batman abusing Robin, it\\'ll be this. Frank Miller you say? I believe at this point I was the one cackling. \\n It was a very Sin City take on Batman, I\\'ll give you that. I could hear Mickey Rourke in my head as I read through the narration. Batman is a little (maybe a lot) crazy. It actually makes sense. It makes sense that a man, who was just a child when his parents were murdered right in front of his eyes, went a little crazy. \\n If you want sunshine and puppies and warm hugs this isn\\'t for you. If you\\'re looking for violence then you\\'ve found it. \\n There are some \"issues\" that have been brought up. People talk about it being sexist, frankly it seems more like realistic to me but maybe that\\'s the problem. We don\\'t want to acknowledge that the world is not that different from Gotham and even our heroes turn out to be not so nice. \\n Homophobic? Again, realistic. Don\\'t believe me? Go listen to a bunch of young boys talk some time and suddenly Robin calling the Batmobile \"queer\" doesn\\'t seem so far fetched. \\n Again, one of the reasons I\\'ve always loved Batman is because it\\'s a little more realistic than some of the others. No flying man shooting lasers and becoming a weakling whenever someone waves a glowing rock at him. (Sorry I don\\'t really hate Superman, truly I don\\'t.) Batman is a guy who has trained himself to fight, who has come up with inventions to help him win his fights and who doesn\\'t always do the right thing because he\\'s only human. \\n Just because I enjoy the book (or anyone reading it enjoys it) doesn\\'t mean we condone the behaviour of the characters within. But I have a surprise for you because they\\'re fictional, they aren\\'t real, Batman doesn\\'t actually exist and I\\'m able to take it for what it is, entertainment. \\n This is what I like when it comes to comics, no, not child abuse, but that it\\'s not for kids. Not at all. This is for adults. It\\'s not nice. It\\'s not G rated. It\\'s not PG. It shouldn\\'t be. \\n Before I go I want to mention the art. That anyone would bash on the art blows my mind. Honestly, I don\\'t get it. The art is stellar. It\\'s not even necessarily what I like but that doesn\\'t diminish how fantastic it is. And someone mentioned Batman getting facial hair when he didn\\'t have it when he started out his night. Some men grow facial hair faster than others. I know men who shave more than once a day because of it. It\\'s really not unrealistic but I guess some folks love to nitpick. \\n This book isn\\'t for the faint of heart or those who like their superheroes with milk and cookies. But for the rest of you, it\\'s worth checking out. I mean really, who doesn\\'t want to see a superhero smacking around a 12 year old boy he\\'s just kidnapped?!'),\n",

       "  \"I'm tempted to bump this up to 5 stars, as it's kind of in between 4 and 5. \\n The Mad Max series of movies are some of my favorite of all time. I've always been a sucker for post-apocalypse stories and (primarily) settings. The latest, Fury Road, is absolutely a blast. \\n This book is the prelude to Fury Road, in that it tells the history of some of the main characters. It starts with Nux, which, to be honest, was just okay. It didn't even make a whole lot of sense how or why of what is going on. It certainly didn't give me any more notions as to why I would care for Nux. \\n Next up was Immortan Joe. I quite liked this story. His rise from a Colonel in the pre-fire collapse, his pirate actions and his eventual taking of his base of operations. It throws a bit in for the People Eater and Kalashnikov (who always seemed a bit of a cartoon character). The writing isn't going to win any awards, but I like origin stories and this one was decent. \\n Furiosa's story on how she met the wives and how they decided to escape was good. Gives good empathy for them and their predicament. Immortan Joe is gross, violent, full of himself, and hints at being gay for his War Boys, rather than enjoying his time with these unusually bathed beauties. The story is much more focused on the Wives than Furiosa though, and I wish we got more about her. \\n Next was a two part series on Mad Max that encompasses the history of the previous 3 movies briefly and then goes into a new story. It was classic Mad Max style with action on the ground and in cars, mixed with some darkness and some light. No one should envy Max's life, it is not a good one. \\n Lastly was a piece on the War Rig and it's various components, from the frame, to the tanker, to the doll heads and a few other pieces. This was made up of one page short stories and was ok, and interesting for a little background, but not great. \\n The art throughout was quite good. The final story about the War Rig was a drastic change in style and I didn't like it as much. Otherwise, there was some nice line work, good coloring, nice attention to detail. \\n While not the greatest of stories done in graphic novel format, it was some great backstory for the movies and characters. Brief, but very enjoyable. I guess if you don't like the movies, don't bother. Personally, I'll probably go through this multiple times.\"),\n",

       "  \"This was a huge gap in my graphic novel knowledge and I had to remedy that. After reading V for Vendetta, I knew I was going to like Alan Moore's version of superheroes, although I wasn't exactly sure what I was getting myself into. I really loved this. Caveat: I think it will be best appreciated by readers who are familiar with the traditional superhero lore. \\n Watchmen starts with the murder of a famous superhero, which is an atypical, but great way of starting a superhero story. Indeed, the whole structure of the comic made me think of noir detective fiction of the really gritty kind. The mistery drives the pace of the whole novel - it is really entertaining. But there's much more to this graphic novel than just entertainment. \\n Once again, Moore has created an uncomfortable and ugly world which reflects the worst of ours. I found this alternate reality to be less relatable than that of V for Vendetta. In a way, this fictional world is a product of the 1980s social problems - nuclear war, Vietnam, the tension between the US and the USSR... The differences with our 80s are subtle, and they mostly reflect changes in technology and consumerism caused by the existence of this particular set of superheroes, the Watchmen. The cars are slightly different, the fashions are similar but not quite the same and sweets have different names. Superhero comics are not a thing, and pirates are all the rage. It's easy to overlook these little changes. Together, they help create a complex new society, different enough from ours that we can feel safe reading this from our privileged point of view. \\n The protagonists who give Watchmen its name are a bunch of atypical superheroes, fallible, flawed. More human than most comic book characters. Moore has used these characters to make us think about the problems of superhero comics, and his critique is superb. Traditional superheroes are constructed upon a set of problematic premises: superhuman heroes are individuals with extreme power and very rigid moral codes. In many cases, they have a tragic backstory to explain their motivations, which turns these so-called heroes in unstable people who express their grief through violence. Problematic, huh? \\n Also, they almost always have their way with the ladies, who don't get to be portrayed very accurately. Either they are the lady in distress, or the motherly figure, or a bitch. Even superheroines are constantly sexualized. So, if you put two and two together, you get a violent and volatile macho ideal as the protagonist of a power fantasy for the reader to identify with. Moore addresses rape openly, establishing that he respects female characters as much as male ones, and that the casual rejection of sexual assault in comics is not okay. \\n I enjoy reading and watching superhero stories (they are fun!), but wish that everyone would be aware of their problems. Unfortunately, some comic book readers have really interiorized this or have found their beliefs reinforced by superheroes, and you know how the saying goes: one bad apple can spoil the whole bunch. Moore's deconstruction is particularly relevant, since this nasty comics reader clique can be very hostile to women and to minorities. My adolescent self suffered the consequences of daring to enter into a comic shop when there was an ongoing Warhammer game. Not nice. \\n I also appreciated the inclusion of homosexuality as a normal thing, with the casual feature of gay partners as secondary characters or as filler/background characters. I was over the moon glad to find that some of the Minutemen were also gay, although they aren't shown in the best of lights. I understand how this depiction is tied to the main point of presenting superheroes as human, but I couldn't help feeling a bit uncomfortable about this dire portrayal of homosexuals. It's not that every gay character in print has to be a saint, and it's not like good gay characters aren't present in Alan Moore's body of work (see Valerie Page in V for Vendetta, for example), so I am possibly being too sensitive. \\n Watchmen also questions the rigid morality that regulates superheroes, thus questioning traditional villains. In the superhero lore, good and evil tend to be quite black and white. This poses the problem of having to oversimplify reality to make it fit inside comics, and can lead to very absurd situations. I'm going to get spoiler-ish from here on, so stop reading if you haven't read this book yet! On the one hand, we have a driven character who supposedly discerns good from evil. I'm talking about Rorschach who, in Alan Moore's own words, is a parody of Batman. His motivation is commendable - he wants to save humanity one person at a time. However, he doesn't mind being extremely brutal to do so and, what's more, he's out to kill whoever doesn't make the cut of his extreme right-wing convictions. On the other hand, we have a very intelligent character who wants to avoid a nuclear war and establish his greatness. He also voluntarily kills half of the New York population to do so. He fits within the traditional villain role, except for the fact that he really avoids a nuclear war that would wipe the human race from the face of the earth. This moral conflict is never resolved, forcing the reader to form a judgement. \\n This novel is also very intelligent narrative-wise. There is a number of metafiction devices involved, and we all know I love that. There are some footnotes, and little excerpts of fictional biographies and interviews which are mentioned during the overarching story. They add depth to the characters and don't feel gimmicky at all. I specially liked the comic within the comic. It worked as a separate substory (I was really interested in the ending of The Black Freight!) but it also tied in nicely with the tumultuous events happening in this alternate New York. \\n The artwork, by Dave Gibbons, is also a masterwork. It is very detailed and very subtle - many frames give more information than the dialogue itself. The complete edition states that Moore himself wrote in-depth descriptions of each frame, and then shows the actual text that was swiftly translated by Gibbons into the iconic first frames, zooming out from the bloody smiley face to the top of the building where the murder has been committed. While it's true that Moore is responsible for the overall layout of the frames, Gibbon's artistic vision is what really has transformed this graphic novel into the masterwork it is, deceptively simple and fast flowing.\"),\n",

Today I\\'m starting a series of reviews covering one of my favourite mangas - Skip Beat! To say the truth it\\'s my third round reading it, and first time was only half a year ago or so. It\\'s still ongoing and because there\\'s too much information in it for only one review, I\\'ll be making a series of it. I will be having some major things as my time lines. But let me begin; oh, but before I begin let me just make a small list of things that this review will cover: \\n * How it all began \\n * Practice, practice & again practice \\n * First TV appearance \\n * A chance to get revenge? \\n First of all, let me start from the very beginning. Meet our main female character - Kyoko Mogami. She\\'s one of those who believes in fairy tales, but at the same time she works hard to achieve her spot of a princess near her prince charming - Shou Fuwa, her childhood friend and newly popular singer. But everything changes when she gets to know the real reason he brought her with him to Tokyo. With her heart broken and Pandora\\'s box open, she is aiming to get revenge and she\\'ll be having these little devils to help her. \\n You\\'ll see anger/devil Kyoko\\'s a lot in the story and they\\'ll make you laugh until your tummy hurts. But how do you get your revenge on a popular singer? You get into the showbiz. Oh, but first you\\'ll need a makeover! And Kyoko gets her, and she persistently runs after the director to get accepted. She get\\'s her wish! \\n if she wouldn\\'t someone would have ended up dead! \\n However, with getting accepted the challenges are just starting! As she has lost a major human emotion she\\'s sent to a newly made \"Love Me\" section. There she meets many different people, who will add more knowledge into her... But this is boring just retelling you the story, even if I\\'m doing a good job. What I really want you to look at is Kyoko. How she\\'s growing as a person as well as an actress. Her ability to assess the situation and make decisions is fantastic and you\\'ll have to see her act numerous times during this 46 chapters. It will be nothing major; okay her last job is pretty fantastic. She made me shiver. But trust me there\\'s more coming. And you do not want to miss any of it. \\n These first 7 volumes and also this review are mostly focused on Kyoko. Well, I\\'ll be focusing on Kyoko only and a bit on Shou. I\\'ll make more time to focus on other characters in the next reviews. We get to see Kyoko from different sides. The one who was doing everything for Shou as well as the one who started to do something for her. We get to see that she didn\\'t have all that happy childhood, however, we only see bits of it. We do not see the whole picture and we are always left wondering as to what really happened to her. \\n However, let me not bore you anymore and just say a few words about the last point on the list: A chance to get revenge? As you remember Kyoko got into showbiz because she wanted to get revenge on Shou Fuwa. Why? Please, read the story, as I do not want to spoil this! You\\'ll be on Kyoko\\'s side, trust me!

       "  'see full review @ Katie\\'s Corner \\n Review covers 46 chapters \\n Hi everyone and welcome back to Katie\\'s Corner! Today I\\'m starting a series of reviews covering one of my favourite mangas - Skip Beat! To say the truth it\\'s my third round reading it, and first time was only half a year ago or so. It\\'s still ongoing and because there\\'s too much information in it for only one review, I\\'ll be making a series of it. I will be having some major things as my time lines. But let me begin; oh, but before I begin let me just make a small list of things that this review will cover: \\n * How it all began \\n * Practice, practice & again practice \\n * First TV appearance \\n * A chance to get revenge? \\n First of all, let me start from the very beginning. Meet our main female character - Kyoko Mogami. She\\'s one of those who believes in fairy tales, but at the same time she works hard to achieve her spot of a princess near her prince charming - Shou Fuwa, her childhood friend and newly popular singer. But everything changes when she gets to know the real reason he brought her with him to Tokyo. With her heart broken and Pandora\\'s box open, she is aiming to get revenge and she\\'ll be having these little devils to help her. \\n You\\'ll see anger/devil Kyoko\\'s a lot in the story and they\\'ll make you laugh until your tummy hurts. But how do you get your revenge on a popular singer? You get into the showbiz. Oh, but first you\\'ll need a makeover! And Kyoko gets her, and she persistently runs after the director to get accepted. She get\\'s her wish! \\n if she wouldn\\'t someone would have ended up dead! \\n However, with getting accepted the challenges are just starting! As she has lost a major human emotion she\\'s sent to a newly made \"Love Me\" section. There she meets many different people, who will add more knowledge into her... But this is boring just retelling you the story, even if I\\'m doing a good job. What I really want you to look at is Kyoko. How she\\'s growing as a person as well as an actress. Her ability to assess the situation and make decisions is fantastic and you\\'ll have to see her act numerous times during this 46 chapters. It will be nothing major; okay her last job is pretty fantastic. She made me shiver. But trust me there\\'s more coming. And you do not want to miss any of it. \\n These first 7 volumes and also this review are mostly focused on Kyoko. Well, I\\'ll be focusing on Kyoko only and a bit on Shou. I\\'ll make more time to focus on other characters in the next reviews. We get to see Kyoko from different sides. The one who was doing everything for Shou as well as the one who started to do something for her. We get to see that she didn\\'t have all that happy childhood, however, we only see bits of it. We do not see the whole picture and we are always left wondering as to what really happened to her. \\n However, let me not bore you anymore and just say a few words about the last point on the list: A chance to get revenge? As you remember Kyoko got into showbiz because she wanted to get revenge on Shou Fuwa. Why? Please, read the story, as I do not want to spoil this! You\\'ll be on Kyoko\\'s side, trust me! However, the chance to get revenge comes faster then expected. She\\'s asked to take part in his new PV, and her role is satisfying: she\\'ll be playing the role of the angel who kills Demon (Shou). Will she be able to able to play her heart well? Or will the hatred take over her and she\\'ll make a fool of herself?

       "  'The first two volumes of McCoy\\'s Doctor Who DWM comics are mediocre, but there are some good reasons: the magazine had lost the ability to portray most of the companions from the TV show; it was occasionally reprinting kids\\' comics from The Incredible Hulk; and it wasn\\'t doing much in the way of continuing stories because there was the fear that it was on the verge of going under. The result was companion-less one-offs that were totally forgettable \\n That all turned around with \"Train-Flight\" in the previous volume, and the new trends continue more strongly here. Ace comes onboard, finally giving us some continuity with the TV show, and the comic shifted back to longer stories, with the six-part-ish \"The Mark of Mandragora\" even picking up a plot thread from \"Train-Flight\". So times were good again (or at least better), if you liked continuity and continuing stories. \\n Fellow Travellers (164-166). This story plays up the new TV connection even more because it\\'s written by script editor Andrew Cartmel. Perhaps the most interesting bit is that we discover that the Doctor has a house in England that he returns to now and then. As he says, \"It\\'s nice having a place in the country. Especially when there\\'s someone who can look after it properly ... when circumstances force one to travel.\" It\\'s not named, but this is surely the House on Allen Street that we meet again in the New Adventure Cat\\'s Cradle: Warhead ... written by none other than Andrew Cartmel. \\n Beyond that, the plot is nicely moody with delightfully unusual and spooky art that\\'s totally unlike most of what\\'s seen in Doctor Who Magazine. Seeing Ace for the first time in the comic is great ... and unsurprisingly she\\'s characterized well, since it was Cartmel doing the writing! [7/10] \\n The Mark of Mandragora (167-172). Fellow Travellers felt a bit like a preview of the New Adventures, but this is a more staid DWM comic strip. With that said the bit where the corridors of the TARDIS get tangled up with a location down on Earth reminds me a bit of Cat\\'s Cradle: Time\\'s Crucible with its similarly fouled TARDIS corridors. \\n This is another story that makes good use of the late TV show\\'s Doctor and Ace dynamic. The use of UNIT is also good, but this is a time period where the use of the Brigadier is more troublesome because it follows his retirement in Mawdryn Undead. However, its helpfully set in 1998, so perhaps he takes UNIT back over following The Dying Days, which was itself set in 1997. \\n Beyond that, this is a fun story because (1) it tries to tie back to the previous adventures and the extraordinary number of aliens coming to Earth to create a bigger arc; (2) it features the return of the Mandragora and thus some nice continuity stretching back to the 4th Doctor; and (3) Dan Abnett is a good writer. [6+/10]. \\n Party Animals, The Chameleon Factor (173, 174). Two short and shallow stories, though the first has lots of nice cameos, and the second has a nice memory of the Second Doctor that makes me wish for Second Doctor comics [5/10]. \\n The Good Soldier (175-178). Although not as striking as Cartmel\\'s earlier piece, this comic does a great job of not just bringing back the original cybermen, but putting them in the 1950s, resulting in a fun story [6/10]. \\n A Glitch in Time, Seaside Rendezvous (179, Special). Another pair of forgettable one-offs. \"Glitch\" is a fun bit of timey-wimey, albeit with horrible art [6/10]. \"Seaside Rendezvous\" is sadly a little bit of nothing [4/10]. \\n That\\'s the end of the comics in this volume, but there are also two short stories. \\n Teenage Kicks! (163). Another Paul Cornell story, this one is unsurprisingly about Seven and Ae and is a nice preview of the maturity of the New Adventures. It\\'s thus a nice companion to \"Fellow Travellers\" and showing how the New Adventures books were linking to the comics [7/10]. \\n Scream of the Silent (Special). An OK short story, but not really what I\\'m looking for in a book of comics [5/10]. \\n Overall, not a great volume of DWM comics, but perhaps the \"most improved\" volume.'),\n",

       "  \"Volume 3 of the acclaimed 'Sandman' series but stand-alone. This edition also contains the original script for the first of its four stories, 'Calliope', which might be of interest to students of illustration. \\n If we are to be honest, Neil Gaiman is engaged in a project to bring 'Tales from the Crypt' up the literary and artistic food chain. There is no doubt that he succeeds admirably in his task, aided by a series of excellent illustrators, but the stories, with the exception of his re-thinking of the origins of Shakespeare's 'Midsummer Night's Dream', are not complex - poetic and suggestive perhaps but not complex. \\n The first story. the 'Calliope', tells of a writer's abuse of an incarnated muse, an exploitation that has its sexual side and which brilliantly makes a creative reader feel besmirched by his own potential for evil in following his artistic ambition. Gaiman and illustrator Kelley Jones' skill lies in making a captured Greek mythological figure into the type of sex-trafficked woman and the artist into little more than a sleazy punter or pimp - a reversal of romantic views of the artist and her muse that is truly horrific. \\n The second, 'A Dream of a Thousand Cats' is a 'take' on another type of dream, not that of ambition but of dream as magical transformer of reality. This is a theme that we know from 'The Matrix' but here it is expressed as the remaking of reality and their history by humans and cats in turn and intentionally leaves us with a sense of unease. It might also be read as a commentary on the potential power of religious faith, born out of suffering, to change the world although the unease remains just that, unease - there is no real evidence here that faith changes anything but the faithful or that the faithful have anything more to look forward to than homeless wandering and more pain. \\n The award winning Shakespearian tale is magical at two levels. It is English-magical in referring back to the Old Religion and the ancient countryside in a way that should have earned it a place at the recent 'Dark Monarch' Exhibition by the Tate on magic and modernity in English art. But it also revisits the issue of the price paid by the artist in his obsessive disregard for a greater personal creation than his play and his bargain with the Dark Lord of the the dream world for inspiration, a bargain as cruel in its way as that of the writer in 'Calliope'. \\n Gaiman is different from all his contemporaries in questioning here and occasionally elsewhere whether the imagination and magic are sufficient cause to abandon the world. The conclusion appears to be that he and other imaginative people can do no other but that they should be under no illusion that what they do is somehow inevitably better or nobler than the lives of ordinary mortals. \\n This seems to be an attitude very different from that of the bulk of the English School of imaginative and magical writers, of which Alan Moore is exemplar, where the world of faery, alchemy, imagination and magic seem to be presented as an alternate reality truer than our mundane world. It strikes me as no surprise that Gaiman would find himself not only living happily in America but seemingly welcoming its modernity in later works. There is an ambiguity in Gaiman that might just, when history judges him, tip him into the very top rank of authors. \\n The final story,'Facade', as if to confirm this thesis, is, by contrast very modern and very American, with a nod to the 'superhero' tradition that never really embedded itself in Gaiman's homeland. In this case, we may have an Egyptian mythological back story and visual references to the Mummy tradition but the core story is one of mysterious government agencies and advanced bodily transmutation in which science rather than magic is dominant. This is the world of 'Superman' if seen through a very dark lens. Ra's magic is as scientific in its way as the speculations of Stoker's main protagonist against 'The Mummy' in the 'Jewel of the Seven Stars' nearly a hundred years before. \\n Taken together, the four stories are variations on the theme of dreaming a myth - of the incorporation of myth into reality, of the use of myth to change reality, of the creative interplay, with its dangers, of myth and reality and of science as a dream or myth in its own right. The Dark Lord of the dream world appears in two of them - where myth and legend are most obviously in sight. The other two have American settings and owe their style to the American comic book tradition. As in 'American Gods', Gaiman is merging European mythic and American popular cultural traditions with not a little genius. \\n It is probably no accident that Gaiman uses a quotation in a letter from the quintessential English writer of the supernatural, magic and the Old Religion, Arthur Machen, to the American James Branch Cabell in 1918 as one of his two introductory quotations. He also quotes separately that all writers are liars. The two quotations set the mood - an artist-writer hybridising two great traditions of magic and modernity but not believing that anything he creates represents anything bigger than a human imaginative creation. Pragmatic, sceptical, Gaiman uses but is not part of the English mystical-magical tradition. \\n Yet, at the end of the day, while the style is brilliant and the themes intriguing, the attempt to go beyond the comic book shows the weakness of the genre. In general, high quality books are far better than the films that they derive from - we think of Moravia's treatment by no less Directors than Bertolucci and Godard. On the other hand, films made from comic books and second-rate pulp fiction tend to be superior to their sources. \\n There is an intellectual hierarchy here whether we like it or not, albeit with exceptions on all sides. This graphic novel is far greater than most graphic material and it deserves re-reading but you sense that it is a stepping stone to the prize rather than the prize itself and has lost something by trying to do more than graphic novels can do. Still, it has to be in any respectable collection and Gaiman certainly gets the best out of his illustrators. You will not regret owning it.\"),\n",

       "  'I didn\\'t really expect much going into this volume of the original Transformers comics. I have never been a big fan of the cartoon or the toys (back then I was more into GI Joes, and later Ninja Turtles). This was like reading a piece of history, I guess. It was ok, but I\\'m glad I didn\\'t pay much for it. I guess it was better than I expected out of a comic that was made to drive toy sales and advertising during Saturday morning cartoons. It definitely read like a morning cartoon. Some of the plot lines were just silly. Some of the types of transformers were silly (like Shockwave and his \"space gun\" that has a handle and trigger. Or the cars that have steering wheels). \\n The artwork was ok, but nothing inspiring. It took a long while for me to really see much difference between the different transformers. Later on, at least a few of them were recognizable, but there were still some that just looked kind of generic. Some of this might be due to the compression in quality as well as compression in size. I am reading this on a 7\" kindle tablet, so that\\'s a fair amount smaller than the original print edition. I ran into problems with the lettering in the same manner. Most of the time it wasn\\'t too difficult to read, though sometimes it wasn\\'t clear. I definitely had to have the screen a closer distance from my face compared to other things I\\'ve read (comics included). \\n I will probably continue reading the classics volumes (I think I have vol 1-4) but highly doubt that I\\'d read them again. My boys would probably enjoy them though. \\n Oh, I should also mention that I got this from HumbleBundle, and assuming it\\'s the same as any other version, but there were a couple issues missing for some reason. I think #3 and #9. I\\'d have to go back and check and I can\\'t be bothered. It didn\\'t really affect too much of the continuation, but maybe slightly.'),\n",

       "  \"Book Three offers a satisfying yet sad conclusion to Snyder and Lemire's three-part After Death mini-series. The last page was pure evil and brilliance, something like leaving a fragrant turd in your brain. \\n For those who are just planning to read A.D. After Death, I just want to tell that this is not for everybody. This is definitely not for me as I expected a story which is straightforward sci-fi, but what I got (I should have known in the first place, when the name Jeff Lemire is printed in the cover) are themes of existential dread, yearning for love, transcending loneliness and death. My reading experience therefore was a bit rugged at the start while assimilating myself with these themes. But once you get on with it, A.D. sure gives you one helluva experience. \\n SPOILERS FOLLOW. \\n A dumb, shallow and overly simplistic way to tell what A.D. is all about is to just say that there is this one crazy dude who plans to escape utopia over and over. I'm sure everybody else in the place are just chill with living forever, but no sir, not Mr. Cooke. \\n A deeper meaning of this would go somewhere in being free and being courageous and not anymore running away from whatever FUBAR situation a person experiences. Snyder's prose effectively delivers this message of chilling sadness and loneliness. \\n The prose part gets a bit long for my taste, and at times I felt like reading a novel instead of reading a graphic novel. Yet I understand that part, that for someone who has overcome death, he has all the time in the world to write volumes of journals. \\n A.D. After Death deserves to be seen in the big screen and I sincerely hope that that plan comes into fruition. This is a sad sci-fi story that everybody deserves to see, despite the fact that the story itself is a little alienating to others.\"),\n",

       "  'Remember, remember, the fifth of November. This is the part of the quote originally commemorating the gunpowder treason and plot to blow up the British parliament building in 1605 by a guy named Guy Fawkes, which reverberates in V for Vendetta - a story of struggle for freedom from a totalitarian world, wherein it is not the people who should fear their government, rather the government must fear its people. Alan Moore\\'s V for Vendetta is a story about revenge transgressing to a revolution of a country. \\n V for Vendetta is a highly political piece of literature meticulously embedded in the mysterious persona and history of V. Like Moore\\'s creation of The Comedian in Watchmen, Gull in From Hell and his depiction of Joker in The Killing Joke, V has attained a certain kind of enlightenment, a sort of point of view high above, seeing all the people below and smelling the stench they emanate. It is Moore\\'s storytelling genius which makes it possible to transcend V\\'s personal Vendetta with the government to driving a society to rise up against its rulers. The longer the people are silenced, the louder their voices would be on the day of revolution. It is not a fight towards justice, for according to V, justice instilled with fear are short-lived and will never create long-term happiness. It is as well not a war for democracy, rather a reclamation of power, power to the people in a state of anarchy. Which is right and which is wrong? Alan Moore does not care about that. For all we know he might be laughing at the people being led to highly intellectual discourses and debates because of his works of fiction. He leaves that question mark for the readers to end it with a period. I prefer to leave it unanswered. \\n Other than the politics of anarchy and facism, V\\'s personality is worth mentioning as well. Alan Moore has created his most complex and mysterious character. On the outside he\\'s an antihero who sought revenge and later became England\\'s symbol of freedom from oppression. But there\\'s more behind the eternally smiling white mask. Based on the graphic novel, V could be anyone and yet he is the one, he is both ugly and beautiful, romantic and straight, male and female, hero and enemy, crazy and enlightened. The suggestion of his (or her) true identity is there, yet Alan Moore has left enough space for reader interpretations. V is arguably the most complex protagonist or character I have ever read. \\n Like his other works, V for Vendetta is carefully crafted and well-researched. Alan Moore has created an alternate history so deep and delicious that the events can actually happen in reality. Moore does not give you a feeling of an unnatural sequence of events because none of his characters are dumb enough to do comical and oftentimes ludicrous antics. All of Moore\\'s characters (except for a few) are human, deep, crazy and intelligent, but never dumb. Moore is also a master of Britain\\'s history, and how he beautifully decorates his creations with such. For one, V himself is a modern Guy Fawkes, or at least Guy Fawkes inspired V to dress-up like that and make the English people remember the fifth of November. One can also see in V for Vendetta references to historic events, say the Holocaust, the eve of the First World War and the Cuban and Argentine Revolutionary War. \\n The artwork of V for Vendetta is dark and awesome. Originally printed uncolored, you can see right away that the artist David Lloyd is a master of shadows. Lloyd has perfected the placement of shadows on objects and humans and especially faces, creating an extraordinary detail each panel. There are two things I find most attractive in David Lloyd\\'s art in V for Vendetta. First are the faces slightly lighted, revealing details, contours and realistic expressions. The other one is V\\'s wig. There may be more complex literary characters than V, but no hairstyle or wig in the fiction realm can ever match the flawlessness of V\\'s wig. \\n The story of V for Vendetta is in fact gripping and powerful, yet it is deep that sometimes I myself am confused with what is happening in the story. It is more difficult to read than Watchmen, Moore\\'s masterpiece which is considered as an intermediate read. There are certain points in the story that are hard to understand that trying to comprehend it somewhat defeats the entertainment and \"leisure reading\" value of graphic novels. But V for Vendetta still connects with the readers, no matter how deep you want to go in unraveling the intricacies in the story. V for Vendetta is a highly recommended graphic novel, with its entertainment element slightly being restrained by the political themes and issues which require a bit of thinking.'),\n",

       "  'My first X-Men comic was Rom #17 (and #18), but after that I hunted down back issues, digging down to X-Men #138. So, I missed out on the Dark Phoenix saga. I got the entirely fascinating X-Men #141 that kicked off the Days of Future Past ... but I couldn\\'t find an affordable #142 for years later. (My grandmother finally bought it for me, even though she didn\\'t really approve of comics.) \\n However it was only in the late #140s that I was able to regularly buy the comic, and so it was the #150s and the #160s that really won me over to the comic, from \"Kitty\\'s Fairy Tale\" (in the last Omnibus), to the paired space sagas here and the introduction of the New Mutants. And, they were amazing: totally unlike anything else I\\'d seen in comics. They covered fantasy, humor, and science fiction. They introduced new characters, but also built on a rich history. I\\'ve been eager to reread these groundbreaking stories for some time, and am thrilled that the Omnibuses finally reached this X-era. \\n The Deathbird Saga (154-157). This space adventure shows the amazing potential of the X-Men in the early \\'80s. It\\'s got an interstellar empire, backstabbing politics, and a weird and scary new alien race in the Brood. There are some rough bits here and there, which I suspect were a disconnect between Claremont & Cockrum, but this nonetheless is amazing, groundbreaking storytelling that still holds up today [8/10]. \\n Shorts (158-161, A6). Back to Earth (158), the X-Men focus on a number of subplots, from the revelation of Corsair to the return of Linda Danvers. It\\'s a nice issue that shows how skilled Claremont was at moving along a number of character arcs. The fight between Linda and the Brotherhood may actually be the weakest part of the issue, though it\\'s a nice character moment for Danvers [7/10]. The Dracula story (159) is shocking for its juxtaposition of horror and the X-Men. It\\'s a nice moody issue, but not a particularly deep one; some time later, Dracula\\'s return (Annual #6) hits largely the same notes [7/10]. Chutes and Ladders (160) may be my favorite X-Men story of all time. It\\'s pretty shocking how much Claremont manages to fit into this tightly compressed story. The timey-wimeyness is wonderful, as all the alternate versions of the X-Men, however it\\'s nothing compared to the magnificent storyline he sets up for Illyana [10/10]. Gold Rush (161) is almost as brilliant for its look at the first meeting between Xavier and Magnus, but even moreso for its recreation of Magnus as a truly sympathetic character, due to his history in the German concentration camps [9+/10]. \\n The Brood Saga (162-168). In my opinion this remains one of the best X-Men sagas for a number of reasons. First, we start off entirely en media res, something seen too infrequently in comics, particularly of this era. Then, the plot is rather magnificently told with the individual issues feeling like they each have great closure, but fitting together like puzzle pieces; the Wolverine and Storm spotlights are particularly good. Along the way, X-Men transforms into a high-end science-fiction comic, with the focus being on interstellar races (the brood and the acanthi). The result is overall storytelling that\\'s not just enthralling, but very innovative as well. [8/10] The return to Earth (167) is a nice coda to the saga, because it pays out the long-running question of who\\'s been sleeping in Xavier\\'s head and also links up to the New Mutants. Some New Mutants lore is really needed to completely appreciate the issue, but so it goes [7+/10] And then \"Jerk\" (168) is one more coda, showing how the X-Men react to their return and why Kitty belongs in the X-Men. It\\'s another nice story, though not as notable as what came before it [7/10]. \\n God Loves, Man Kills. The Dark Phoenix Saga gets all the attention, but this graphic novel is at least as much of a masterpiece of Claremont\\'s \\'80s X-Men writing. All along, mutants have been used as a metaphor for the underprivileged in society, but this is the volume that makes it explicit, equating them to blacks and Jewish people alike. It also features extremely human villains in Stryker and the Purifiers (both of whom continue to make waves decades later), but if anything these humans are more dangerous than any other enemy the X-Men have faced, thanks to the dark, grittiness of this tale. The artwork by Brent Anderson is also terrific: vastly superior to almost any comics of the time. [9/10] \\n Morlocks (169-170). This two-parter is crucial mainly for what it introduces to the X-Men mythos: the Morlocks, another imaginative and interesting Claremont invention. The story itself, with a kidnapped Angel, is just minorly interesting until Ororo takes on Callisto in one of her greatest character-defining moments. [6+/10] \\n Rogue (171). The introduction of Rogue to the X-Men is superb for its deep continuity and for what it says about Professor X and the role of the X-Men [8/10]. \\n Wolverine (mini-series). Claremont and Miller\\'s original Wolverine miniseries is still astoundingly good. The integration of Wolverine into Japan is perfect, especially with its combination of modern crime and ancient Samurai culture. The characterization of Wolverine himself is also very strong. Hand-in-hand, Miller really steps up with the artwork, especially in the final issue, which is sublime [9/10]. \\n Wolverine\\'s Wedding (172-173). This is a very nice continuation of the mini-series, but with X-Men. What\\'s particularly impressive is how Claremont manages to spotlight so many characters. So we get the continuation of the plot with Wolverine and the crime families, even bringing in the Viper plot from New Mutants; then we get a nice arc of change for Storm; and finally we get a lovely acceptance of Rogue into the X-Men. However my favorite may be a couple of panels of Madeline with Lockheed on page 722, long-before the character assassination that followed the appearance of X-Factor. Overall, an excellent comic on many levels [8/10]. \\n Dark Phoenix Returns (174-175). Three years later, it was very appropriate to return to the question of Dark Phoenix, and also to give answer to the questions about Madelyne (for a time, at least, as Claremont insisted on muddying the waters afterward). It\\'s a nice mini-story, particularly for showing what a badass the highly trained Cyclops over. Overall, a nice anniversary story that puts Jean Grey to rest once and for all (until the marketers got a hold of her for X-Factor. [7+/10]. \\n Scavenger Hunt (A7). One of the few classic Claremont X-Men stories that\\'s totally not worth reading. It\\'s a long snipe hunter after the Impossible Man that\\'s supposed to be funny and usually isn\\'t. Skip. [1/10]. \\n Magik! X-Men #160 was amazing, but it left many questions unanswered, like what happened to Illyana in her 7 years in Limbo. The answer could have totally sputtered out, but instead Claremont excels, offering a story almost as great as its predecessor. Part of the joy is seeing these weird, warped version of the X-Men. Part is seeing a bit more of timey-wimeyness. But the best part of the story is simply the terrific depiction of Illyana\\'s apprenticeship: how she went from being an innocent girl to the dark childe. Sadly, when Illyana\\'s story finally came to a close in Inferno some years later it wasn\\'t nearly as good as what was set up here [8/10] \\n Claremont obviously still has it in these stories, but his era of greatness was quickly coming to an end.'),\n",

However, it\\'s not a light story, there are a lot of themes that no one should ignore. I\\'ve already read 5 maybe even more of this author\\'s works and in at least 3 of those the family issue has been stressed a lot. I do not know if it\\'s still such a problem in Korea, but apparently at the time of writing this story the parent-child relationship was a big problem. It has been stressed in many other author\\'s works too, that the parents were giving the boy more importance than the girl. Yep, absolute sexism there, and especially when I\\'m a girl, and I have been an only kid to my mom and her parents, I do not get it, how Song Ih\\'s parents and grandparent could do that to her. I mean this issue left a big impact on me. They worked their asses to only pay for their son\\'s tuition and they discarded their daughter as if she was nothing. The last chapters made me explode, were he parent even human?

       "  \"see full review @ Katie's Corner \\n Today as always is a manga day and I have something romantic with a bit of weirdness. Yes, yes it's a weird romance story. But then again it depends what you think weird is. Well, let me tell you more about the story itself. \\n Meet our protagonists - Yuka and Taichi, a high school student and a high school teacher. They are siblings, well, not really yuka's dad married Taichi's mother, and then they left for an early honeymoon without registering their marriage and leaving their kids living together alone. So, what's going to happen now? Well,... Now, let me say why I said the manga was a bit weird. I was absolutely frustrated with Taichi's sister complex. It was fun first 3 volumes, but then it just started getting on my nerved. I mean how much of a siscon he could have been. Also I was waiting, and waiting and waiting for the romance between those two to finally bloom, bit I didn't get it. The ending also doesn't really say a lot. Will they be together or not? There were quite a lot of moments where the characters realized their feelings, but I had a feeling as if the author just discarded them and then got back to Taichi's sister complex as fast as she could. \\n The only character who actually made me happy was Shin, he was the only character that I loved reading about. I so wanted that Yuka ended up with him. He was the only character who could actually say his own feelings clearly. If you forget the whole romance thing, the manga is amazing and absolutely fun to read. There are many moments that crack you up. Some jokes are very repetitive, but they are still funny. The person who cracks you up the most is always Tachi and especially Yuka's expressions at different moments are something to remember and just print out to laugh at. \\n I hope you will get some time to read this fun manga. Maybe you'll enjoy it more than I did. If you do or not, don't forget to share your thoughts with me below! Stay tuned for more reviews ad well as promos here on Katie's Corner!

       "  \"What a mess this turned out to be. What a great cover (and the other covers from the 4 issue run, they are shown in the back of the book). Too bad the writing was so bad. The premise and the setting and the potential are great. An immortal ex-soldier is kind of a detective for hire in the supernatural world of L.A. (unbeknownst to the 'normals'). He's hired by this super rich super racist that wants to bring about hell on earth (or at least California, though arguably it's already there [ba dum tsh]) by sacrificing his daughter, who is somehow the antichrist (her name is Anita Christ....) and it's partially concocted by this old vampire. \\n For pointless reasons, our hero is involved in a dispute about rising rent for his friend named Freddy Chtonic, who has to do with Lovecraftian Old Ones and he has tentacles for his mouth, and also speaks frequently in alliteration (which ends up more annoying than anything. Also the guy that can't pronounce Rs is irritating to read). There are some other vampires, and they are also connected to the bigger vampire. The writing is just all so convoluted and dry. I get mostly what's going on, but none of it really makes any sense. The ending in particular was questionable. Anita turns into this werewolf beast after the hero, named Antoine Wolfe (who apparently has this huge reputation), gets all shot up (but remember he can't die). Then they drive away together. The end. what? I think volume 2 said it takes place 20 years later or something. I'm still deciding whether I should bother reading it. \\n The artwork is passable. It's simple linework with broad flat colors. It works, but it's anything but exciting. Which fits the writing I guess. Unrealized potential in both aspects. Also, there were tons of inconsistency in continuity. One moment a girl is in the back of a police car, nothing in her hand. Then the officer mentions something about her never letting go of this necklace. Next thing you know, she's holding it. It makes no sense to not be consistent there. Also, some shadows under someones nose. Now they're there, now they're not. And other things.\"),\n",

       "  '** spoiler alert ** \\n Overall, I enjoyed the story. Original Clark & Lois on the New-52 Earth. They are in hiding as to not reveal the fact that they were placed on this Earth as a result of \"Convergence\". I don\\'t recall the Convergence storyline, so I don\\'t quite remember how they ended up on the New-52 Earth. \\n Clark & Lois have a young son, Jonathan, who they are trying to protect. After the New-52 Superman was outed by Lois Lane, they decided that they needed to stay in hiding and not reveal themselves to the world. Lois is a journalist working on a book under the pseudonym \"Author X\" about a large crime syndicate Intergang. Intergang wants to stop the release of her book and attempts to kidnap her and Jonathan. Clark/Superman (in a black costume reminiscent of his suit from the \"Return of Superman\" storyline) comes to their rescue. \\n Clark is also dealing with the return of Hank Henshaw to Earth after being away for years on a space mission. Due to his dealings with Henshaw from his Earth, Clark takes him to his Fortress of Solitude to see how he was affected by his travels. While there, Henshaw is controlled by another \"prisoner\" in the Fortress, Blanque, in his attempt to escape and wreak havoc across the world. \\n It is revealed that Henshaw brought back part of the Oblivion Stone, which a new threat, Hyathis, wants. There is a typical brawl between Superman & Hyathis, with our man in black winning (kind 0f). Hyathis disappears with an \"Until we meet again\" exit. \\n In the end, Jonathan learns that his dad is Superman from another Earth, and that he also has powers. Clark gives Jonathan his read Superman cape from his original suit. Jonathan ties it around his shoulders and attempts, succesfully, to hover in the air. Just a glimpse of the powers he will possess. \\n As I said, I enjoyed the story. The writing was good, but I feel comic book writers have a hard time writing kids. The kids always seem to have a larger and more mature vocabulary than I would expect. Even some of the conversations between adults in this one seemed stiff at times. Lee Weeks are was great and kept the story moving. \\n This story leads right into the DC Comics\\' Rebirth, with the original Superman back in continuity, along with Lois and Jonathan.

Rick Jones is the piece that will decide humanity\\'s future, so there are big names interested in him, either to kill him or protect him. A bunch of assorted Avengers, Rick himself, Kang and Immortus battle it out while doing a very handy tour through Avenger\\'s history, both \"actual\" and alternate. One thing that Busiek does right is integrating all retcons into a tight narrative, which is not at all easy. I\\'m sure I missed a trillion references, but everything is explained well enough so that I never felt lost. On the other hand, his dialogue is stilted and the story really doesn\\'t make much sense until the last three issues. And even then I can see some plot holes if I think it carefully, but I\\'m just gonna roll with it in name of fun. \\n Regarding the art: the panels are crowded. It might seem cool to stuff a lot of Avengers and their alternate versions into a panel, but the trick grows old quickly. It\\'s just tiring to try and make sense of what you are seeing, specially when both good and bad Avengers look so similar. So I ended up skipping the art and just reading the bubbles. \\n Note for future self who will want to keep track: Avengers Forever is also the Destiny War.'),\n",

       "  'I suspect like more than a few readers, I came away with \"FOREVER EVIL,\" DC Comics latest drum step in an endless, seemingly annual, and increasingly exhausting \"earth shattering epics.\" A fan of Johns work, there was actually a lot in this book to make me eager at the outset. The art is nothing short of luscious. It matched the story, which in many ways seemed like a delightful throwback to the earth crossing JLA stories of the 80s, when they\\'d try to get together with the JSA from Earth 2, and everything would blow up before you knew it (often with the Crime Syndicate of America showing up to the party). So in every way, I assumed that this was a sure homerun. \\n To recap - and I\\'ll do this briefly because others have done it already and to avoid spoilers (unless you\\'ve not read Trinity Wars and have been in a cave, in which case stop reading!) - Forever Evil is the culmination of another recent \"Earth shattering\" DC crossover stories (\"Trinity Wars\"). It turns out that event was a manipulation by members of the Crime Syndicate of America, an evil version of the JLA, formerly of Earth-3 (sort of an unfunny bizzaro world where evil rules and good can\\'t get ever get a break). Earth-3 destroyed, the CSA escaped to earth in order to set up shop and pretty much wiped out the heroes on arrival. That leaves it to the villains to protect their turf from these multiverse carpet baggers. And of course, who leads the villains but Lex Luthor. \\n Now there\\'s already a lot here to like. As any writer/reader knows, villains are usually the more interesting part of any equation. Lex Luthor, one of DC\\'s villain archetypes is at his most interesting when he is battling Superman because he sees the last son of Krypton as a crutch preventing human greatness (and preventing people from fully appreciating Luthor\\'s genius, of course). That matches up well with Lex fighting Superman\\'s evil twin, Ultraman (selfish, butthead, who needs kryptonite to maintain his power. Get the idea?). I am also a great fan of the CSA. Before Johns, lots of other writers have explored the CSA to great effect. John also does \"cosmic\" better than almost anybody in comics (saving Starlin), which makes this a story brimming with promise. \\n The problem, however, comes when the story hits a rather saggy middle. A careful reader will notice that Johns seems to hope that we won\\'t notice that the Lex telling the story at the end (Johns cleverly puts the story in Lex\\'s perspective) isn\\'t the same as the Luthor of the beginning. His motivations and his world views are transformed. And, no, it doesn\\'t make sense in the story either, save that Johns needs him to change in order to get the book to where he wants it (which of course previews the next \"Earth shattering\" event...). The way the story ended also left me cold. While my spoiler phobia prevents me from going into detail, the end spells big changes for the whole DC universe and I for one doubt that they\\'ll be changes for the better (two big changes stand out, but again, no spoilers here!). \\n Johns dialogue remains strong and when this book works it really comes together. Still, I can\\'t help but think that it was almost a third too long with not enough happening to justify the pages. If you are a DC follower, I suspect you\\'ll have no choice but to read Forever Evil. Just down expect it to blow you away.'),\n",

       "  'Moore\\'s first volume of Providence is shockingly mediocre. \\n I mean, the premise is good. City reporter learns about a secret USA and walks behind the scenes of a series of Lovecraft stories. So, in these four issues we get \"Cool Air\" (#1) , \"The Horror at Red Hook\" (#2), \"The Shadow over Innsmouth\" (#3), and \"The Dunwich Horror\" (#4). \\n But, Moore doesn\\'t really do anything interesting with the premise. He twists names and places, to hint that these are the \"real\" things that Lovecraft then made into fiction. But, there\\'s no deconstruction, and no real variation other than the names. Beyond that, we essentially get cameos: no prequels, sequels, or behind-the-scenes stories that reflect upon the originals in an interesting way. \\n Worse, Moore weighs these stories down with pages of dull textual supplements in every issue. Most of them are the protagonist\\'s views of the story we just read. Again, there\\'s nothing interesting in this different viewpoint of the story. A horrible, hard-to-read handwriting font makes them all the worse. (I realized that I was happier not reading them after I set issue #3 aside for days because I couldn\\'t bear to read the text at the end. I think the fact that it took a full week for me to read these four issues says it all.) \\n The best thing I can say about the volume is that Moore\\'s Lovecraftian knowledge is clear and the art is quite attractive in a clean, pragmatic way. \\n If I hadn\\'t already bought the other two volumes, so that I could read them all back-to-back, I\\'d probably stop here.'),\n",

       "  \"I was intrigued by The Vision's background in Marvel's Age of Ultron movie so I decided to give this a try. A book of two halves - the first (published in 1958) telling one origin story of The Vision created by Ultron to infiltrate the Avengers. The second is a more modern retelling of The Vision's origin as a Synthezoid (synthetic humanoid). Although created in the 1940's and when his technology is stolen by the pre-war Nazis - there are repercussions on a present day storyline where the granddaughter of The Vision's creator is essential in stopping a global apocalypse. \\n For a newbie to The Vision, I found both stories to be entertaining and fun to read. Credit must be given to the movie makers as there are a few homages to the original 1950's graphic novel. I enjoyed the drawings and fast action. The writing was a little sparse at times, but there are a few moments of reflection upon the nature of humanity and artificial intelligence which The Vision is clearly conflicted over. \\n Easy to read, I was able to complete this in one sitting - I'd recommend for any newcomer, like myself, to the Vision or if you're curious after watching the movie.\"),\n",

It matches the cover, so it is a very cute, simple art style that is very easy to get into. That being said, what you see is what you get. It's not very complicated. I prefer my graphic novels to be a little more complex where I have to pay a bit more attention to the frames and with this one, you can skim most of them. \\n As far as the plot, I enjoyed the story. As a fan of video games myself, it was fun to see and I knew about some of the topics that were brought up in the book and the issues that arose. With that being said, I found the story rather predictable. I also found it to be shorter than I expected. I would have loved for it to be a bit longer and to see the characters develop more. They ended up being one dimensional. \\n Overall, I liked this graphic novel. It was cute, fun, and light. It is a nice break between heavier reads. I would recommend it to any video game fans or anyone who is looking to get into graphic novels and wants something light to start out with.This review was originally posted on Thoughts on Tomes\"),\n",

       "  'For those so interested, the copy I\\'m reading is here. \\n To know thine enemy ... one must read their writings. But, in doing so with Dr. Frederic Wertham, I noticed that there was more similarities in the way he and I thought, than differences. The premise of this book, by the way, was not to ban comics forever (though, shortsighted that he was, he did not see the artistry they would become in the future) but rather institute a restriction on who can buy which comics at what age. You know, what we have in place for movies, video games, some music and even books now. He wanted to take the \"Crime Comic Books\" (which included the Suspenstories as well as Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman) and restrict those to the 15 and older crowd. \\n For those who refuse to read it (or try and can\\'t get past the fact that this is an editorial essay on the evils of comic books), here\\'s the main arguments: a) the linking of violence and sexual imagery has created sado-masochists, b) the prevalence of gorier scenes in comic books have forced other media to follow suit (namely television and movies), c) the crowd being targeted by the ads are too young to understand the \"motives\" (when any are given) behind the scenes of violence if they even see more than just the pictures, d) all of this combined creates an atmosphere where delinquency is viewed as normal and powerful and morality is viewed as passe and weak. \\n In the end, I do believe that there does need to be a balance between those comics meant for little kids and those that are meant for more adult readers. I also believe that finding a way to let the little kids who still need to learn balanced emotional health have access to only those comics which do not glorify what is destructive to societies is wise. \\n However, I do disagree with a few of his main reasons for the arguments (besides the general well-being of the children). First, if his only interaction has been with children who \"became maladjusted\" after reading these books, than it doesn\\'t matter if they really are a minority, his whole point of view is skewed. And in a democracy - a true democracy - there is rule by majority. What we have done in the US (supposedly) is try to take into account the minority opinions also and balance out the majority versus the minority, but he claims that rule by majority is not democracy at all. He claims, in fact, that by letting the majority rule, we are preventing democracy from occurring. Also, he claims that comic books have no redeeming value and this is a horrible falsehood. The fact that he didn\\'t recognize a burgeoning art when it was being birthed is a big problem. That he could not see they would have literary value (and, in fact, did at times back then also), is unfortunate. \\n That these same arguments have been used for movies, television, video games, music and will be continued to be used forever is a tragedy of our world. Those who make the arguments do have the society\\'s best interest at heart, I do not doubt that. But that we can\\'t find other ways of helping educate all people in finding and praising the \"good\" as well as the \"horror\" is the root of the problem. \\n As far as his writing goes, it was fun to read someone so sarcastic.'),\n",

It is something like this: \"it would have been funny, if you didn\\'t have to cry over it.\" This manga shows this side of life which we all want, but it is described in such words that you don\\'t really want to experience a relationship now. The title which is \"No Longer a Heroine\" is just amazing. It already shows that something is not just right with the heroes we are going to deal with. \\n I remember that I actually dropped this manga because I had to study for exams and then even forgot about it for the next two months, because I found something more exciting to read. But here I am now covering this manga. It has an amazing amount of comedy and even bigger amount of drama. The main characters are so ... , I guess I can\\'t even find a word to describe them. They are just people. They are not similar to other typical shoujo manga characters, who make their choices and know what they want to happen (not every shoujo manga character is like that, but at least 80% of them are).

Yep, happened to me, thankfully, my lecturer shared this passion to read manga, so I was not scolded a lot. \\n I was really excited at the end, however it didn\\'t really satisfy me that much, I mean, she just had to be left with the other guy.

She always sticks to her and you will see many examples of it throughout the story. \\n All the fun starts when Narugami appears and first starts telling Eiko but then after he falls in love with Eiko, he starts pursuing his love why was h. why was he bullying Eiko in the first place? Well, his best friend dates Moe, and then she dumped him because of Eiko, so Narugami though to bully Eiko so he could get at their friendship.

       "  \"This first volume of manga for Cake is pretty much what I expected it to be unfortunately. The slim 43 page manga, two pages of which are black pages with one line text, has streamline the first four chapters of the book. As to expected of a visual version, a great deal of the story is lost, unfortunately I didn't feel the artwork made up for the loss. \\n Done in standard yaoi style the characters look very much the same in build and facial features. I also wasn't fond of the amount of face/half body shots use toward the end that seemed to fill the entire panes leaving very little white space or background. For me it was just to crowded looking. It also made the last scene lack action since there was mainly face/half body shots. The plus side for those that didn't appreciate the more violent rape theme of the book the manga has watered that down completely. There are some nude shots but not alot and no graphic sex at all. \\n As for content the book has: The running on the treadmill and in the shower thinking. The past at the bar where Sex is remembering meeting Marcus. When he wakes up with his eyesight is covered in two pages. Sex getting thin and punishment involved. Then Marcus coming home and for a drink of blood and sex before announcing he is going to kill Sex. All of this is bare minimum on story. I miss the snack pack comment :( \\n It is a 8x10 volume with a nice glossy cover and sturdy pages with lots ads for their books in the back. No text on the spine since it is so thin. It is also left to right. It didn't take long to breeze though this volume. Although the artwork in manga style the length, physical size, and read direction doesn't fit the genre. At $9 a volume and with the length the book making at least 6 to 7 volumes to finish the first book I can't say this is anything other than a manga for hard-core fans of the series.\"),\n",

       "  \"By the seven seas, Crisis on Infinite Earths is a long read for a comic book trade paperback. What is meant to be read for a year is not meant to be read for a few days. A maxi-series of epic proportions, Crisis on Infinite Earths literally destroyed universes and traveled dimensions even beyond space and time for an epic series that simplified the DC universe and paved the way for other publishers to do line-wide crossovers - something which was unheard of during that time. \\n The year was 1985, the same year I was born when Crisis on Infinite Earths was published. Even without ample knowledge about the gold, silver and bronze ages of comic books, I can say that this a very well-researched piece of work. I discover at least one new DC hero, superhero and villain at every page. Kudos to Wolfman and Perez, they managed to fit in all those characters in one story. The story is simple: all DC characters must unite against a single foe to save their whole multiverse. The salvation comes with a hefty price. There are so many catastrophes and deaths here. Whole universes are annihilated in just a few pages. \\n Infinite Earths has so many meta-comments that tell the survival of life as the survival of DC itself. It kinda makes me wonder how really big this event was during the year it was originally published, how many characters and stories you have to kill (some may have been built for years) just to clean the slate and simplify the DC line of publications for new readers. It was effective for me when we are talking about DC's new 52 as I am picking up Bats, WW and Aquaman until now. \\n Aaah. \\n You cannot blame Wolfman for making an otherwise straightforward story a bit crowded and convoluted. We are talking about 50 years of history here. And they must have some degree of respect by making sure that each patch of history is shown here, albeit rather short. The plot progressions felt formulaic and repetitive at the final chapters, making the end a little anticlimatic. Moreover, many character (especially hero-villain) pacts are made to be overly fast just to conveniently move the plot forward. This is understandable but awkward. \\n Almost 30 since its publication, the DC multiverse is alive and well again. The Crime Society is back, Supergirl still flies, Earth-2 exists, Barry Allen is still running and many more. Infinite Earth's effects may have faded. And it has to be that way because for something to survive, it has to progressively evolve. So yeah, DC forever.\"),\n",

       "  'As was often the case in the late Claremont era, the three X-Men titles are clearly ranked. X-Men has the best writing, and although it\\'s not at its height of a couple of years ago, and occasionally goes over-the-top and becomes accidentally farcical, it\\'s still pretty great at times. New Mutants is next, primarily held up by the great characters that Claremont created, but definitely headed downward since his departure. And X-Factor is worst, because no one made the original X-Men that interesting during the period, and Simonson wasn\\'t the best writer. The nice thing about this collection is that both Claremont and Simonsson are writing a little better than you\\'d expect for this time period, so it\\'s better than average. \\n X-Factor: After the Fall (27-28). Louise Simonson\\'s writing was often this weakest point of this X-era, and these issues show why. They\\'re both very shallow, something that\\'s not helped by the very comical art. It\\'s nice to see X-Factor begin a new era, past the Ghostbuster silliness of their first few years, but nothing particularly constructive happens in these first issues (other than learning about their ship). [5/10]. \\n X-Men: Deadly Games (228). A filler issue if there ever was one, plotted by De Falco not Claremont. It\\'s dull and at the time it was very frustrating, having to wait another month to find out what had happened to the team [4/10]. \\n X-Men: In Australia (229-230). This was really the start of a fine new sequence for the X-Men. The Reavers are a great new foe, and the whole new setup is fun, but the Christmas issue is actually what really shines here, with the X-Men just doing .. good [8/10]. \\n New Mutants: After the Fall (62-64). These shorts are all nice character pieces, though they\\'re all slow by modern standards. The Amara story is probably the best, and shows off what the later New Mutants could have been without cartoonish Brett Blevins art. The Illyana story is a fun one-off, even if it\\'s largely a filler story. The burial of Doug is a rough piece that also captures Warlock\\'s alien-ess well [6/10]. \\n New Mutants: Sorcerer\\'s Duel (65-66) / X-Men: Dressed for Dinner (231). One of the problems with Fall of the Mutants was that it pretended to be a big crossover, but it wasn\\'t, it was just three different stories, of various levels of importance. This is one of the stories that made up for that, because it reflected one of the major events (the Death of the X-Men) in another title (New Mutants), and it\\'s pretty wonderful, because Illyana decides to go after Forge. There are huge plot holes in this arc (mostly centering around Freedom Force and Forge still sitting around Dallas months later ... but maybe we assume that Illyana jumped back in time). Despite that, it\\'s a great arc, not just for the plot, but also for Illyana\\'s characterization (and some of the most important setup for Inferno) [7/10]. The X-Men issue is then a very nice follow-up on similar topics, as Illyana and her brother meet [7/10]. \\n X-Men: Brood! (232-234). It\\'s nice to see the X-Men in their new role as global players, and it was pretty astonishing to see the Brood back, on Earth for the first time! (They\\'ve been vastly overused since.) The mixture of the brood with mutants was a fun twist, and the bloodthirstiness of this fight is breath-taking. It\\'s amazing that Claremont was able to have three issues be focused on a fight and still make it interesting thanks to the constant character moments! And of course back at home base, we get the rest of the setup for Inferno; great to see it being offered so far in advance (combined with all the Illyana focus over in the New Mutants). [7/10] \\n The Evolutionary War (Annuals). The years of crossover Annuals were not Marvel\\'s finest hour, but these aren\\'t bad. At least each title gets to tell a self-contained story with the possibility to be meaningful to the overall title. X-Factor\\'s rescue of a mutant moloid was pretty forgettable. The New Mutants\\' rescue of Magma was better, other than the bone-headed move to change Dani\\'s powers, because Simonsen couldn\\'t understand how a nightmare-and-dream-based power could be useful. The X-Men\\'s restoration of the Savage Land, and their continued role as \"legends\" is the best ... but then the backup story unleashes one of the worst, juvenile disasters ever on the X-Franchise: X-Babies. Bleh. [6+/10]. \\n X-Factor: Infectia (29-31). Infectia is a fun character, and she suits this comicy artwork well. There\\'s a lot of farce in this arc, which plays well, and it\\'s overall enjoyable, if a bit long [6/10]. \\n X-Factor: Avengers (32). Unfortunately, this fight against fake Avengers isn\\'t nearly as good. There\\'s some nice characterization of the kids, but that\\'s it [4/10]. \\n X-Men: Genosha (235-238). It\\'s the verge of Inferno, and Claremont creates ... Genosha. Yowza. Not only is this a vastly important bit of background that continued to influence the X-Men mythos for years, but it was also one of the first real science-fiction looks at the X-Men, approaching their story in a \"If this goes on\" manner, rather than just using them as a stand-in for prejudice. Even beyond that, this is a pretty great story, particularly its focus on Rogue and the the takeover by Carol Danvers (as well as hints about the true origin of Madelyn). Sure, there\\'s some dialogue that\\'s become pretty wonky, and the story is about an issue too long, but this is still great stuff. [7+/10] \\n New Mutants: Lila in Space (67-70). Sadly, the main books end with Simonson at her worst. First up, we have her introduction of the second worst New Mutant ever, Gossamyr (who was only outranked by Simonsson\\'s Birdbrain). Then we get a long MacGuffin quest where Lila is kidnapped by a spidery alien named Spyder (seriously!). This could have been a great space-faring story, but it\\'s dull and doesn\\'t take any advantage of cosmic Marvel. The only good part of the story is the lead-in to Inferno ... which is burning brightly by the end [4/10].'),\n",

       "  \"Chapter 1 --A little friendly violence, a little friendly homophobia, a little friendly racism, and Tony Chu and John Colby (ex-partner turned cyber-faced FDA newbie) are as partners-in-love as they ever were. So they start investigating a piece of shit, which leads to some pee, some more violence, a glimpse of Colby's cyborg powers and some actual detection (Batman Detective Comics could learn a valuable lesson). It is a fun though slight beginning to the second volume.Chapter 2 --Chicken is illegal in Tony Chu's world, so it is a black market item, but now, apparently, there is a plant that may taste like chicken, so Chu is off to Micronesia to track the plant (fruit?) down. \\n I must talk about something more serious, however. It is time to address the fact that the FDA and USDA of Tony Chu's post-Avian Flu world are as nasty, as intrusive, as violent, as powerful, as fascist as any of the genuine US security agencies today. Sadly, John Layman's satire has never once seemed far fetched in its political, governmental, security imaginings. It is scary that the para-militarization of two supposedly benign existent agencies barely registers as odd anymore. In a book packed with oddities and impossibilities, this is the one thing in the book I can see happening, and that is depressing, and I'm going to say it will likely be prescient. Just you wait.Chapter 3 --Chew is satire the way Soylent Green is people -- hell, it's reminiscent of Jonathan Swift -- so the powers of Chu and others, the speculative politics, the fowl dystopia, all these elements ease our potential tension in the face of the satire and make it completely palatable -- and believable. \\n Case in point: the personality of Chu. He started way back in #1 as a reserved man, an anxious man, a hungry man, a man full of self-doubt and nervousness. But when his cibopathy led him to the FDA and cannibalism-for-justice, all his traits morphed; Layman gets that change just right. Chu is becoming more intrepid with each bite of human flesh; he's becoming more aggressive and much angrier too. And this little bit of real world detail, this believable growth of character, makes the satire much more palatable.Chapter 4 --Vampires AND a Cibolocutor. Wht's that you ask? That is a guy who can translate any work of art -- like a play or a song -- into a dish, thus transferring the emotion generated by the art into the flavour tasted by the diner. C'mon! That is cool, isn't it? Not as cool as the fact that the Vampire is on the Micronesian Isle to liberate (or eat?) the Cibopath. But Tony Chu is on the case, so look out Vampire. \\n I don't care how silly this book can be. The moments of mountainous creativity on display, along with the scathing satire, make this one genius book.Chapter 5 --Another neatly and quickly wrapped arc is over, and for all the entertainment International Flavour gave me I feel cheated. Things went a little too fast this time, and the plot was a little too big for five short issues. \\n Still, I am digging the Vampire (not-Vampire?), which should make the future comics fun, but I think Chu's burgeoning romance with Miss Mintz is my favourite ongoing thread of the tale (which surprises the hell out of me). So even if things are moving too quickly for my taste, Chew is still a solid comic, and I must keep going, but International Flavour is definitely a let down from Taster's Choice.\"),\n",

Sure, I LOVE the Sandman like nothing else, but my humble trades had served me (and the dozen or so people I had lent them to) just fine, why did I need to spend $400 re-collecting a series that I already had and had already read? \\n The answer: because they\\'re pretty. Like, really really pretty. \\n I broke when I read on Neil\\'s blog that they were going to be re-coloring the early part of the series. Those early issues, which I\\'ve always thought had kind of chintzy art and look kind of, well, terrible in the trades have a new life in this volume. The high quality paper and dramatically improved color separations completely change the scene where Morpheus escapes from his prison, giving it a power that it\\'s lacked for all these years. \\n Also, the form of these books dramatically changes the experience of reading these stories. Thumbing through the trade paperbacks simply can\\'t compare to sitting in your favorite chair with an oversize, 8 pound book on your lap. It turns reading Sandman into a physical as well as mental and emotional experience in a way that I hadn\\'t anticipated. \\n So yeah, I\\'m basically a patsy for DC\\'s marketing department.

       "  \"As a person, I have my own history of violence, and that history has led me to become obsessed, as a thinker and author, with violence as a concept. I see it everywhere. I dwell on it, am awed by it, wonder about it, write about it, dream about it, nightmare about it, loathe it and love it in turns. Thus, when I pick up a book with the title A History of Violence, I expect to read something that engages with violence consciously, something that doesn't simply use violence for visceral gratification but has a plan for the violence, is using it to say something (even if that something is something I don't like). \\n John Wagner's A History of Violence says many things about violence, but what bothers me is that I never once felt like the things being said were intentional. I felt like Luke in the cave on Dagobah: everything in the cave was there because I brought it with me. \\n Wagner's writing left me hollow and sad. He was merely telling a story, one he needed to tell, perhaps, but only to move a plot B to C, then back to A, then C to D. He seemed totally disconnected from the thematic life of his work, and I felt abandoned by him as I made my journey through the text. As I write this I think that in itself, that abandonment by the author, is a unique and potentially powerful authorial authorial -- but I don't like being the object of that action. \\n Moreover, I despair that someone could use the sort of violence that appears in this graphic novel with what seems to be flippant disregard of its power. Similar violence occurs in David Fincher's film Se7en (in fact, Wagner blatantly stole one of the seven killings from that movie for this book), but Fincher's use of violence feels conscious, pointed, thematically aware, and that makes all the difference for me. \\n Vince Locke's is scratchingly, noirishly lovely, well suited to the bleak world Wagner has written, but it only added to the alienation I felt. \\n I know I am going to have to come back to this book in the future and give it another read simply because it made me feel so strongly. I didn't enjoy this book at all. I put it down feeling angry, isolated and disgusted. I wish I felt like those feelings were intentional rather than incidental.\"),\n",

       "  \"This was a little disappointing as the first volume in a series widely touted as innovative. Of course, looking at something in 2010 is not going to be the same as looking at in 1994 when it was first published but it does not stand the test of time in the way that the Sandman series of Neil Gaiman or the work of Alan Moore has done. \\n Morrison is not stupid. He plays well with the tropes of Chaos Magick (never mentioned but central to the thinking behind the book) and with the psychogeography of London. \\n He is well within an English tradition of mixing magic and public culture, one that has been a highly fertile source for American popular culture and whose literary output comprises such luminaries as Ackroyd, Sinclair and, most recently, with 'Kraken', China Mieville. \\n But the graphics are conventional and Morrison himself can be wordy. He stretches things out a bit on occasions so that you end up asking 'where's the beef?'. No graphic novel should ever permit the stifling of a yawn as one does while listening to the self-indulgent wittering of 'Old Tom'. It also leaps around too much with an odd rhythm - too much meandering in one part and too much jump-cutting in another. \\n I would like to think that this was some deliberate strategy to mimic Chaos Magick theory but, if so, it fails. Chaos Magick does not work through external but through internal narrative. Here, you never get the chance to sustain an engagement that will shift your mental gear into new paradigms - you are, too often, being preached at, the exact antithesis of the Chaos mentality. \\n So much good work has been done around the idea of a second magical and sinister London under the skin of the one that we see (if we are resident) every day that this one seems pale in retrospect. This first volume is a violent and post-modern concoction that owes a great deal to the spirit of Foucault - a sort of creative version of those near-contemporaneous graphic accounts of philosophy provided as cribs by Icon Books and others. \\n The unfairness of this review is the unfairness of over fifteen years of shelf life. There are striking images and ideas but there is something adolescent and gratuitous about it ... a text to show how Vertigo managed to open up new themes and ideas for the generation born in the 1970s, much different from Alan Moore's own embedment in that same dystopian decade, but not one that truly 'enlightens'.\"),\n",

Why is that a 11-year-old threatening her with losing her job? That\\'s for you to find out. The only thing that I\\'ll say is that we finally get to know the real Kanae. We meet her family, it\\'s a weird bunch, and we can finally see how hard she tries to achieve her dream. We also find the answer as to why she couldn\\'t stand Kyoko in the beginning. The bond between two girls deepens, and we are happy for Kyoko, as she finally made her long wished female friend! You\\'ll be laughing at the stunts Kanae will be doing. And her idea of playing with kids? Hilarious! And don\\'t forget that Kyoko will have to use her superpower at some point in her attempt to find out what Kanae likes. \\n But let\\'s move on! It\\'s time for Kyoko to act in a drama. She is not the main character, but her role is very interesting and hard to play. Was there an audition? No, she was recommended because of Shou\\'s PV, or actually because the directors were friends. As Shou\\'s PV didn\\'t air to contribute to Kyoko\\'s popularity. But the role has a catch and if Kyoko can\\'t understand her character well, she won\\'t be able to play her role well and won\\'t be able to surpass the original. I forgot to mention that this drama is a remake? Sorry, sorry. Kyoko will have a tough time coming up with her Mio, but when she finally does; it will blow your mind and you\\'ll be left shivering! I\\'ll give you a hint: her character is a young mistress, whose heart is filled with hatred. Kyoko will put this hatred to the extreme and trust me you want to be there to see when she transforms into Mio Hongo! It\\'s fantastic! \\n However, not only Kyoko will have problems with her role. Ren Tsuruga will be at a loss, as he can\\'t play a man in love! But before that let me tell you a bit about Ren, or actually about his and Kyoko\\'s relationship. They started bad, really bad, as Ren didn\\'t like that Kyoko was in showbiz for revenge. However, over the time their relationship was getting better, and right now they both need only one push to acknowledge their feelings. Well, Ren already did, but he locked them away, because of his secret. What is the secret, even I do not know it yet. The only person who can read Ren\\'s fake smile is Kyoko and their encounters are always fun and interesting to watch. Especially, if Ren is angry and has a radiant smile on his face. Devil Kyoko\\'s are going ballistic at that times. Actually in the most chapters after Kyoko found her Mio, the story is focused on Ren. We get to know him a bit better, there\\'s still a lot of mystery around him, especially why he can\\'t love anyone at this time. But nevertheless we get to see him from different sides. When Bo aka Kyoko is giving him hints as to what love is, his expressions are just fantastic and you should really see what kind of expressions he makes, but do not forget how he actually came to understand his role! That parts when he sees his feelings for Kyoko are incredible! \\n I\\'ll be finishing now, but do not worry; more interesting moments await you when you start reading this story.

       "  'This miniseries starts out as a retread of the flashback scenes in Batman / Huntress - Cry for Blood: Helena, who was sent off to Sicily after her immediate family is murdered, is still there and now dealing with the loss of her second family, this time to prison in a crackdown on mob hitmen. Aside from an amusing moment where Barbara Gordon is in town for a \"Mafia Continuing Education Training\" with a bunch of government lawyers and legal librarians, the first two-thirds of the book are Helena creating herself as Huntress against the Sicilian organized crime families. It\\'s not about Batman, although it is about Gotham -- people keep blaming her Gotham upbringing every time she does something unladylike, and when she first puts on her newly commissioned uniform the man she confronts smirks and says, \"You must be an American...we don\\'t have capes in Sicily.\" So that\\'s pretty awesome, and the art is nice: it\\'s decent for DC standards these days, and I really like how everything in the entire book is dark (I don\\'t think there\\'s anything brighter than twilight through the whole thing, and most of it\\'s at night and/or underground). \\n And then Helena chases the mob back to Gotham, runs smack up against Batman and Batgirl, and the whole thing goes a little crazy. \\n Here\\'s an example of Bruce Wayne\\'s dialogue, addressing Batgirl after she breaks in to rescue him (in civilian guise) from Huntress: \"You\\'re fired.\" \\n Batgirl: \"What?\" \\n Bruce: \"Damn it, you almost blew my cover -- did you think I couldn\\'t handle it? Are you crazy? Are you crazy?\" \\n So, yeah. Crazy. Barbara\\'s mostly in this to give Helena a foil, which means that she gets beat up a lot and accomplishes nothing of any use. \\n (Although she does get one actual good exchange with Bruce: \\n Batman, meeting up with Batgirl on top of a building: \"Bruce had a body bug on Nino, and that\\'s how we were going to find out where the hard evidence is, but now Nino\\'s dead. What\\'s the look on your face for? \\n Batgirl: \"I think it\\'s funny how you talk about \\'Bruce\\' as if he isn\\'t you.\" \\n Batman: \"It\\'s not funny.\" \\n Batgirl: \"Okay, it\\'s not funny.\") \\n Now, Selena is actually interesting. She drops in to partially break up a fight between Huntress and Batman and gives Huntress of page\\'s worth of really good advice on fighting Batman, and then finishes her speech off with: \"Now run. You can\\'t beat him. Trust me.\" Then she leads Huntress away and gives her another speech about how she wants to see more strong women who answer to no one in Gotham. \\n Then there\\'s a lot of violence and the story ends with a whole bunch of unanswered questions about the mob families back in Sicily. \\n On a side note, an odd continuity question: There\\'s no mention of Robin, and at one point a mob boss needles Bruce about marrying his date (Selina Kyle) and having kids -- which is a funny dig at Earth-2 Huntress, who\\'s Bruce and Selina\\'s daughter -- although it could be explained by having a ward not considered a proper heir. (It also explicitly breaks continuity with Batman/Huntress: Cry for Blood in that Helena never sees Batman until she\\'s already Huntress, but I like that change even though in general I think that Cry for Blood is a better story.) \\n The one thing I really liked about this miniseries was how it used Helena\\'s origin story to inform so much of her vigilante style. Of the assassin who killed her family when she was eight she says: \"The man stood in the doorway. In hindsight, there was a moment when I could have done something. I don\\'t let that moment pass anymore. These days, I tend to pistol-whip first, ask questions later. Call me crazy, but...no one...will ever...do that to me. Never, ever again.\"'),\n",

       "  \"A book that takes place in the Marvel universe. I know the book says X-Men but this is more a Wolverine book than a X-Men team book. In this one, different mutants are being kidnapped and now they have their eyes on Mystique and Wolverine. All the kidnapped mutants have one thing in common. They all were part of a mission that took place years ago. \\n This book had two different timelines. One was the present which represented Wolverine and Mystique trying to rescue the kidnapped people and the other timeline was the mission that had these characters sharing a common thread. I liked this aspect of two different timelines as the reader had two different perspectives of the characters. I thought the author did a great job with the portrayal of the characters and I liked the inclusion of Black Widow. The confrontation between Mystique and Black Widow was well done and worth the read alone. This book was part mystery as the reader and characters had no idea who was responsible for the kidnapping. \\n The only negative aspect of this novel and also the reason I lowered my rating was the ending. It was a little too concise as I was expecting a huge final confrontation and the ending to this book was flat. I understand the author probably couldn't do much with the characters as he has to stay within the limits of the comic book story lines but nothing was really accomplished and it left me wanting more. \\n That being said, I enjoyed my foray into this universe and I did enjoy my time with these characters. This book did accomplish one thing for me. It would be great if somehow the movie teams of the Avengers and X-Men could share one screen as this book hinted at that and I believe all fans of these characters crave that.\"),\n",

       "  \"At first, I was hesitant to request this graphic novel on NetGalley because I know it'd be disturbing and uncomfortable to read. And obviously, this graphic novel turns out to be NOT AN EASY READ. \\n First of all, these are not made up stories. They are REAL, and they were mostly submitted online anonymously. We are all aware that all these acts happen commonly in real life, and it saddens me to even just think about it. These acts are ugly and gross. And we shouldn't turn a blind eye and act like nothing has happened. \\n AND THAT'S WHY THIS GRAPHIC NOVEL IS SO IMPORTANT. \\n These days, I've seen a lot of comments saying that all these acts happened because of the victim's faults. People blame the victims because they are the ones who 'asked' for it, because of their appearance, because they wear revealing clothes and let me tells you guys, THESE ACTS ALSO HAPPENED TO PEOPLE WHO COVER THEMSELVES. I'm not telling that it's okay to wear revealing clothes because honestly it's not but THE MOST IMPORTANT THING that needs to be changed is people's mindset. NO ONE IS ASKING TO BE SEXUALLY ASSAULTED. And I'm relieved to know that the author hasn't focused on female victims only, there is also a story where one man was raped during a blind date. \\n People should be able to feel safe wherever they go and whoever they are with, when they are walking down the street at night, and when they are with friends, family, and significant others. It's distressing to know that some people that we trust would betray us and take advantage on us. This shouldn't be happening. I honestly can't imagine the impact of these acts has on someone's life. And guess what, you can't, until you've been through it. \\n On the other side, the artwork is beautiful and stunning and it is so simple yet so powerful enough to convey the message. The idea of turning stories about sexual harassment, sexual violence, and sexual abuse into graphic novel kind of scares me actually. I want it to look real but at the same time, not to be explicitly illustrated. And I think the illustrations are fine, but bear in mind that some wouldn't be appropriate for kids. The author also included some advices at the end of the graphic novels, for both victims and people who would want to talk to the victims/people who are aware of the acts. \\n Again, THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT GRAPHIC NOVEL. And no one should have to go through these things. These are not compliments, at all. \\n Thank you NetGalley and Jessica Kingsley Publishers for providing me with an eARC in return for an honest review.\"),\n",

       "  'Bravo! The golden duo, Kazuo Koike and Goseki Kojima has created a truly remarkable masterpiece not just in manga, but in literature as a whole. Let me just write this for the record: after reading Gabriel Garcia Marquez\\' creations, I have never thought I would feel this so much satisfaction again in reading. The Lone Wolf and Cub, in all its glorious 28 volumes definitely gives its readers a unique experience - a VIP trip to feudal Japan and front row set to the most exhilarating swordfights that ever graced the literary world. \\n Why is it and how can be that Lone Wolf and Cub is that good, so good that it single-handedly increased my overall average rating here in GR by a handful of notches? There is no sole answer for that. The best and fastest answer I could give is that you have to experience it for yourself. Stop reading this text and go grab that first volume, read until the very last chapter of the last volume. By then you will understand what I am feeling. \\n The Lone Wolf and Cub is waaaay more than a revenge story set in the Tokugawa era of Japan. It talks about so many things. It is a story between a father and his son who has to fight all those who come against them, be it ninjas, samurais and ronins, or the murderous weather. It is chock-full of assassination episodes where you won\\'t tire seeing Itto Ogami carrying out such. It is also a highly political-historical work, where the hierarchy of Japan\\'s government are embedded in the series\\' fictional political strife and scandals. Lone Wolf and Cub is both a tragedy and celebration of bushido, or \"the way of the samurai\". Tragedy because tons and tons of warriors have been killed following the code, with a significant amount of deaths were carried out by men and women who despise doing the kill, yet code adherence forces them to do so. This is also a celebration of bushido because there are so many characters in this series (including Itto Ogami and his arch-nemesis Retsudo Yagyu) whose actions reek of high respect to the code. It is also huge tome of religious references, from shinto belief, Buddhism, to meifumado, to poetic references to the stars, the wind, the wave. \\n But above all, the whole manga is raved by its action. The artwork perfectly captures the swiftness in each stroke of the sword, the efficiency of the blade as a killing instrument and the bloodbath it leaves after the fight. The Lone Wolf and Cub after all is a fight between two true samurais. \\n I have read Samurai Executioner and yet to read Path of the Assassin, both of which are works of the golden duo Koike and Kojima. All I can say is that Samurai Executioner, a great series nonetheless, pales in comparison with the Lone Wolf and Cub. The Lone Wolf and Cub has a special place in my reader heart. \\n The last chapter, oh yeah. The series did not fail to surprise until the very last pages of the last chapter of the last volume. It is a perfect conclusion, after being so invested reading the story. It was worth all the time I have given in reading it. \\n To Mr. Koike and (the late) Mr. Kojima, arigatou gozaimasu! You have my respect and admiration.'),\n",

       "  'I don\\'t know why, but I don\\'t much care to write a review, yet I feel compelled to do so. And because of that you get point form adapted from a discussion I\\'ve been having about the comic while reading it. \\n *One of my favourite parts of League of Extraordinary Gentlemen Vol 2 are Kevin O\\'Neill\\'s pencils. The way he exaggerates features through understatement is difficult to describe, but there is a sort of Victorian reality that he captures that is really effective. Another cool bit of pencilling is when O\\'Neill places the League in the background and foregrounds the people of England, fleeing from the cities, getting drunk in alleys, whatever. It creates a sense of the people surrounding Alan Moore\\'s anti-heroes, which isn\\'t something you always get in comic books. \\n *There is a cool cameo from Dr. Moreau and all his \"Moreauvians\" (thanks for the new word, Amber), all of whom live in a forest. The art is bizarre, almost comical, and I had trouble getting into it to begin with. It turned out well though, and I think it really suited the general aesthetic. And there were plenty of extra references to children\\'s lit that I liked. \\n *Big fan of Wilhelmina Harker in the second volume. I see now that Moore is trying to show us a strong woman in a Victorian England which completely frowns on strength in a woman. Quartermain\\'s control begins to slip, and it is banished entirely once Mina takes him to bed. Mina is in control of who she and Quartermain are. \\n *I liked the first sex scene in the Inn, but I didn\\'t care much for the outdoor sex scene that is intruded upon by the Moreauvians. Together they show an interesting shift back and forth between Mina in control and Quartermain trying to regain the control he\\'s lost, and it is nice to see that his attempt to regain control is Moreauvians (I just like hearing that name in my head). \\n SPOILER ALERT (look away)*The rape(s). What to say? I wasn\\'t convinced that Griffin actually raped Mina, although there seems to be some implication of that in her diary response after the Invisible Man\\'s attack, but since the only violation from Griffin we actually see is Mina\\'s severe beating, the question of rape remains up in the air. Interesting, then, that her rape (if that is indeed what it was) is withheld, but we are given a clear view of Hyde raping Griffin for revenge. It is a unsavoury piece typical of Alan Moore\\'s work, His heroes are nowhere near as heroic as heroes are supposed to be. And even calling them anti-heroes seems too kind. They are villains whom we delude ourselves into thinking are heroic; they\\'re not heroes.SPOILER OVER \\n *Volume 2 is much better than Volume 1. \\n *I wonder if any of those who died are actually dead. I doubt it. It is a comic book after all, and there was much talk amongst the characters about staged deaths. A little foreshadowing, I\\'ve no doubt. \\n *I love Nemo. Mina\\'s my favourite. And Quartermain is my least favourite, but I appreciate the role he plays. And Griffin and Hyde fascinate me. \\n *Avoid this movie at all costs. It is utter crap. Such a shame that it will likely be the last movie Sean Connery ever makes. \\n *The Almanac contains tons of interesting stuff, but it is boring. Seriously boring. Sleep inducing, in fact. \\n That\\'s it for my lazy list. Hope you enjoyed it.'),\n",

       "  \"This manga tore my still-beating heart out of my chest, stomped on it and burned the remnants to ashes. \\n It's so incredibly beautiful. A true work of art. It dealt with the issue of teenage depression and suicide in such a delicate and cautious manner. I don't think I've ever read a story/novel that dealt with this issue so well before. Kakeru has a wonderful support system in the form of his friends. \\n And Suwa.... you beautiful, beautiful man. Incredibly strong character to be willing to give up his future family for a friend. What a lovely person. \\n One of the elements I appreciated most in the story was how saving Kareku was a slow gradual process with many setbacks. Depression isn't cured by one act of kindness or happiness, it is a monster that needs to be constantly kept at bay. Often the characters would do something wonderful for their friend that would alleviate the darkness but would find him regressing the next day into that pit again. That is something I profoundly appreciated because that's how it truly is with depression. Ultimately, the choice to live was Kareku, when he became aware of how his suicide would impact others and was 'afraid' to lose his life, for the very first time. The choice to live IS your own to make and no one person or event will magically change someone's mind. I really loved that that was addressed. Also, at the very end, Naho comments on how fighting off the 'sadness' will be an everyday struggle, which is very true. Very delicate handling of the issue. Truly appreciated. \\n My only criticism stems from the fact that, despite the noble intentions of his friends, suicide is a medical disorder that can't just be brushed aside with 'good memories' or encouragement. Treating this conditions requires professionals and medication, which goes beyond the scope of what teenagers can accomplish. It's not really their fault. This is just something that goes way beyond what they can offer.

Two people I know read a couple of issues then stopped, and a few read the first issue but no more. Only I have read the entire series in my less than immediate vicinity.And when I\\'ve brought up Fashion Beast it has been to a universal cool. Even those who\\'ve read some of the series responded with little more than a shrug and a \"meh.\" \\n This is a shame because Fashion Beast is as accomplished a piece of fiction as anything Moore\\'s written with (perhaps) the exception of From Hell (yes. I am actually saying it is as accomplished as Watchmen). It is a tormented and tortured retelling of Beauty and the Beast characterised by sexual ambiguity, abuse, power struggle, dystopia and psychological horror. And that is just the crust of the story. Dig deeper from the crust to the inner core and Fashion Beast is revealed to compress itself into subsurface layers of storytelling, layers we must work hard to uncover but whose uncovering is absolutely rewarding. \\n There are layers of perception, of reality and hyperreality, of anarchy, of fascism, of evolution and human interference with evolution, of fable, of morbidity, of asexuality, of transexuality, of subjugation and domination, of class and economics, of signs and semiotics, and these are just some of what make up the earth of Fashion Beast. \\n I have read some criticism of the screenplay structure of the tale, since it does come from an original Moore screenplay written in the eighties, because the screenplay structure doesn\\'t mimic the issue to issue structure of a comic narrative. I understand that feeling, and perhaps that has something to do with the response of those who\\'ve only read a couple of issues. This structure does mean that the story takes time to reveal its shape, but if one gives the cinematic orogenesis of Fashion Beast time, if one allows for a different pace of graphic storytelling, one will find the shape as pleasing as the more natural shapes we read everyday. \\n I suppose it is unfair to suggest that the lack of interest in Moore has to do with hipsterism. I think, in the end, it is simply that he challenges us too much (whether in form or substance). \\n He is like Orwell of comic book writing. Everyone says his name in hushed tones, everyone has read Animal Farm (Watchmen), and everyone claims to have read 1984 (V for Vendetta), and hard core readers (scholars and activists) have read The Road to Wigan Pier (From Dead), but going any farther is just too damn much work, so we admire Orwell (Moore) from a distance, recognize his importance, claim to be fans, but stay away -- always -- from the literature on the periphery. It\\'s easier that way. \\n So I get that. It just bums me out because genius tends to go un(der)appreciated.'),\n",

Well, let me end this reminiscence about time and get back to the review. \\n Let's say this: currently (at the time of me writing the review) there are 100+ chapters and 17 complete volumes. We've proceeded into the story a lot, but at the same time we know very little about every character. To say the truth I wanted to write the review when it all ended, but I thought better of it, then I had another idea. Divide it into sections, and I'll have about 4 reviews right now. But in the end as soon as I unraveled a major secret that has been bothering me for the last maybe 50 chapters, I had this inspiration to share this amazing work with you. I will try to minimize the spoilers and focus solely on the feelings that I had when reading this story. Okay, first confession time. I might have missed this fabulous manga if it wasn't adapted as an anime in winter 2015. I think it was then maybe it was fall 214. And let's say that I got impatient and started reading ahead before the anime finished airing. So as always I was spoiling all the fun for my otaku friends and myself. But you're interested in this, right? Sorry for getting distracted all the time. \\n The story will follow a 16-year-old princess named Yona.

Yona and Hak (that's the general of wind tribe and Yona's and Soo-Won's childhood friend) go into hiding. They travel to find a prophet so Yona can find her path. She does, she will have to go on a journey to find the 4 descendants of dragons, and so they help her achieve her goals. What are her goals? Well, that's for you to find out. As there will be many adventures on her quest first to find 4 dragons and then to achieve her goal. The story has many adventures and it covers many life problems. Every new chapter has something new to give us. It teaches us of honor, friendship, goals and many more. Every character is interesting in its own way. We still have a lot to learn about everyone. Many more secrets need to be unraveled and many misunderstandings to be fixed. \\n Now let's move on a bit. If you're looking for something romantic you'll be a bit disappointed. There are some moments, but not so many to categorize this manga as shoujo and romance as its first and main genres. Ii may be wrong with shoujo, as for the time being it is a shoujo manga due to the main character still being a girl - Yona. Who am I rooting for as a love interest for Yona? For sure Hak, but if you are a fan of series, tell me which team you are in too! If you're new to this manga, read it! It's fantastic and you'll love everything there: characters, plot, character and plot development, action and so many adventures that you'll find yourself sucked into it in no time. \\n Are you ready to finally find out what Zeno's ability is? I nearly died of shock when I saw what he could do. It's fantastic I mean it. Your blood will boil, your imagination will work in overdrive and I believe you'll love it! So what are you waiting for?

       "  \"I loved this book! The Stuff of Legend: Book 1 The Dark is a Graphic Novel, it stands at 112 pages. It was released by Del Rey on April 27, 2010. \\n Analysis: When I first heard about the idea of toys fighting amongst themselves to free their owner from the claws of the Boogeyman, I immediately knew this was a book that I needed to look into. In a heart warming, sometimes scary at times way, The Stuff of Legend: The Dark is a wonderful novel with some amazing illustrations. \\n As this is a first novel the storyline and characters are all introduced to readers. There are various characters that really stick with readers and others that have yet to truly shine but this is definitely a great start to all of the characters. Another area that is really developed is that of the land and world of The Dark. The combination of the description/storyline and the beautifully drawn pictures the world really is mapped out for the reader. \\n Although I don't want to compare it to Toy Story, it really is a bit of a wicked toy story feel to it. Imagine Toy Story for adults. This novel has an innocence to it, but at the same time has a few scary parts, and the characters are all facing tough decisions regarding loyalty to each other and their owner, and what they should do when it comes to fighting other toys. \\n Those readers that like a full resolution to plots won't find it in this novel. This is very much a first installment and the story is definitely deeper then what is presented. While this makes the next installment a must read, if it isn't expected it could leave readers a bit disappointed. However, when all these graphic novels can be read back to back it will be a real treat. \\n The strongest aspect of The Stuff of Legend is truly the illustrations that are present. While some graphic novels choose to go with the vibrant colors, this one goes with sepia and brownish tones. This choice of colors fits with the setting and the whole novel. The time period of the novel is 1940s, and the representation of the toys coming to battle in the Dark really stands out with this color choice. Beyond the color choice is the details of the illustrations, every time I read this novel I found something else outstanding about the illustrations. \\n While the illustrations are amazing, don't think that it will overshadow the story because it doesn't. The story and writing is just as lovely and will really pull at the strings of readers hearts while they start on this journey. \\n In the end, I loved this graphic novel. I cannot wait to get my hands on the next installment to see what will happen. It's a wonderful start of what looks like a great series. The Stuff of Legend: The Dark is truly a story that is heartwarming with a powerful message. It's sure to be one of my favorite novels/graphic novels of 2010!\"),\n",

       "  'I\\'ve never been one to fear change, but reading The Ultimates: Homeland Security makes me wonder if that creeping illness of aging is starting to catch up with me because I don\\'t like what Mark Millar\\'s done to my favourite comic book hero and my favourite super team. \\n Now, I get that the Ultimates aren\\'t the Avengers and that the Ultimates universe is some sort of weird parallel land or something, but no matter how we dress it up, The Ultimates is an attempt to \"reboot\" the Avengers in an age of reboots. The problem for me is that the rebooting hasn\\'t added depth; instead, it has made the story shallow and seems to be taking Captain America and the Avengers back to the days of Rah! Rah! propaganda. \\n When Frank Miller gave us The Dark Knight, changing Batman forever, he took a glossy, rather silly, detective-style superhero and gave him real angst. The comic went from light weight action fluff, to heavy weight psychological drama, and that change was healthy. \\n But Mark Millar isn\\'t doing the same thing here. The thing I have always loved about Captain America was that his ideals didn\\'t always match the prevailing political mood. Captain America has often done what he thought was right even if it pitted him against his friends, the law or the government. He wouldn\\'t follow orders just because they were given to him. They had to be right too. Yet, in the Ultimates we see him actively joining in the cover-up of Bruce Banner\\'s identity as the Hulk, and even covering up the Hulk\\'s intentional Manhattan tirade - a raging Hulk smash fest that killed several hundred New Yorkers - because to blow the whistle on the Reichstag Fire moment would cost SHIELD and the Ultimates their funding. The Captain America I know and love would never let that stand. \\n Captain American has always embodied American ideals, not American reality. We have Iron Man for that. \\n In the Ultimates, my Avengers have become a government run, government supported, government funded \"defense system.\" Gone is their autonomy. Gone is their honour. They are government thugs working, quite literally, for Homeland Security, and suddenly Marvel Comics is beating the propaganda drum - and not all that subtly - for the Patriot Act and everything else that makes me sad about the USA. \\n I will give this series one more chance. I\\'ll read one more graphic novel, but if it doesn\\'t improve I will bury the experience deep inside and pray that this isn\\'t the direction Joss Whedon\\'s Avenger film is headed. That would be one of my saddest cinema experiences - ever.'),\n",

       "  'Apparently people aren\\'t too fond of Savage Wolverine -- at least around these parts -- but I am not one of them. I am a definite fan, and here\\'s why: * Wolverine -- The angry Canadian killing machine isn\\'t my favoritist character, he might not even be in my top five, but I do like him a lot, bordering on love (okay ... I love him), and anytime he can cut loose with those claws of his, I am on board for the cleaving. Cho makes great use of the Savage Land as a place for Wolvie to unleash the beast within, and brings him back to himself with the presence of beautiful and deadly, Shanna the She-Devil. \\n * Shanna the She-Devil -- Yummy, yummy Shanna. Click here to see how I really feel about her. \\n * Gorgeous Art -- If there is one area in which creator Frank Cho excels it is in his art, specifically the way he draws fantastically curvy women (his women remind me of a polished Frank Frazetta), but also in the way he conveys action. It is quite beautiful. I can see how some may feel his work is too clean (not to be confused with sterility because his work is full of life and nuance) and that it is more suited to an art gallery than the pages of a comic, but I find that polish a welcome change from what we normally see, and I look forward to Cho\\'s art as much as I do Esad Ribic\\'s. \\n * Humour -- Another area in which Cho excels is in humour. He makes things funny without being precious, and that funniness makes things fun. With little jokes, situational humour and the occassional visual gag, Cho lightens the mood of even the most savage moments. It\\'s a skill very few comic creators have. \\n * Amadeus Cho -- I wasn\\'t expecting the appearance of big brain Amadeus Cho, but what a seriously cool surprise. Usually Cho is connected to Hercules, but he\\'s always popping up in random arcs all through the Marvel Universe. Frank Cho uses Amadeus as his greatest outlet for humour, but he also lets Amadeus\\' childlish arrogance free, giving his manipulative powers free reign to mess with Savage Land aboriginals, mutants and \"green rage monsters\" alike. \\n * Dinosaurs & The Savage Land -- What can I say? There are dinosaurs in the Savage Land. DINOSAURS in the SAVAGE LAND! Exactly. \\n * Flair for Cool Moments -- But then there\\'s this other thing that Cho does so well: he offers up memorable moments that will stick with readers for all time. Case in point: how can anyone do anything new with the Hulk? Turns out it can be done. Hulk is hulking out, Wolverine is riding his back, and Wolvie decides to put the big green guy down, so he puts his fist to the side of Hulk\\'s temple and SNIKT -- the claws come out and into Hulk\\'s brain, and the Hulk is unconscious. Nothing else because, after all, he\\'s the Hulk, but he\\'s knocked out in the coolest way possible. Super cool.I suppose I can see how this wouldn\\'t be for everyone, but it is definitely for me. It\\'s not the best thing in Marvel NOW!, but it is a whole bunch of fun. Huzzah! Savage Wolverine.'),\n",

       "  'Green Arrow #1Super rich superheroes who are more vigilante than hero (a DC specialty) are tough to enjoy, but their increasing willingness to break laws, to employ their riches to behave like a state with a state, to surveille, to torture, to coerce -- all illegally -- all with the breezy justification, \"At least we\\'re the good guys,\" is making their ilk almost unreadable for me. \\n When Marvel pauses to consider their \"privileged\" heroes, it feels like there is much more criticism going on, a recognition that they may not be as \"good\" as they themselves think, but DC\\'s rich boys -- especially Green Arrow, but Batman too -- just seem to be propagandizing for the goodness of the rich, for their moral superiority, for their protection of the capitalist ideal. I need one of these joker\\'s allies, like Naomi Singh or Alfred to do more than tell the hero they\\'re supporting that they are uncomfortable with something they\\'re doing; they need to remove their support and take a stand. I need them to do this if I am going to like these superheroes anymore.

It\\'s all set up for Green Arrow to take a beating, and it is all a yawn. \\n This comic is moving the plot along too quickly and expecting us to follow without earning our commitment. Issue one hurt my brain a touch, but I am entering full migraine zone now.Green Arrow #3poor action, a preachy monologue of Ayn Rand proportions. What\\'s to like? In addition, if you\\'re one of those who complains about the way people are inexplicably fooled into missing the fact that Clark Kent is Superman, don\\'t read Green Arrow. Oliver Queen/Green Arrow makes Clark Kent/Superman look like Clayface. There is NO WAY anyone who meets Oliver then seens Green Arrow one second after Oliver disappears should or could ever be fooled. It is fucking idiotic.Green Arrow #4Enter Blood Rose and a new arc. She\\'s okay with guns, super strong, in love with a freak, and is yet another moron fooled into missing the Ollie connection by Green Arrow\\'s silly green goggles. The writing has now moved from JT Krul (who did as marvelous a job on Captain Atom as the shitty job he did here) to Keith Giffen, and it is in no way an improvement. Is it the writers? Is it just the nature of Green Arrow? I think it could be the latter. I think Green Arrow, at least outside the Justice League, simply sucks.Green Arrow #5Toxic Sludge Freak, who likens himself to Swamp Thing (you\\'re not you douchebag) happens to be the boyfriend (lover?) of Blood Rose, comes to kick Oliver\\'s ass. They fight. There\\'s a banal end twist. Thrilling. Next ....Green Arrow #6So the Toxic Sludge Freak is Midas, the titular villain of this volume, and his love affair with Blood Rose turns out to be a somewhat promising storyline -- but that is the only positive I can take away from Green Arrow. I hate this version of Oliver Queen; I hate the corporate machinations; I hate Green Arrow\\'s support team (computer genius girl and tech genius boy); I hate the villains; I hate the action; I hate the book\\'s politics. I pretty much hate this book. I was about to add Green Arrow to my file at Black Bowser. Nope. Not now.'),\n",

       "  \"The Coolness-- \\n * The main idea of iZombie vol. 1 Dead to the World is a thing of beauty if you're a horror fan (especially if you dig zombies). Gwen dies, wakes up undead and discovers that she has to feast on a brain a month or become a shambling mass of rotting flesh with an insatiable appetite. She is not just cute, she's hot (as David pointed out in his review, this is a wonderful change from the zombies we're used to seeing), and she has to navigate our everyday world while fighting and feeding her hunger. The premise is gangbusters! \\n * At the back of the book, we're treated to a gallery of Michael Allred's beautiful black & white pencils. Most of them are potential covers for future issues, and they reveal a real depth before the colours are added. It's really a shame that they chose to colour iZombie at all \\n * Revenants. If you are a horror fan and don't know what this is, you're not really a horror fan. I'm not sure where they are taking this yet, and I am not convinced I like Chris Roberson's take on the Revenant, but the fact that it is there at all impresses the hell out of me. \\n * Mummies rock. \\n The Meh!-ness-- \\n * The plot went in too many directions for me -- which is a symptom of the crappiest part of this book (see below) -- but when the story stays with Gwen's survival and out of the Diner, it is worth reading. I hope the second volume does a better job of sticking to what's good, but I know that's too much to ask. Whatever, I liked it enough to keep going, even with its faults. \\n * There's some pseudo-nudity that bothered me a bit. If the story had been more adult oriented, if it hadn't felt like a monster prequel to Friends, if its tone had been more Sookie than undead-Veronica Mars, I would have cheered on the sexuality and looked forward to more, but iZombie was too cute for that, and as long as it stays too cute any nudity is too much nudity. It just doesn't fit. \\n The Crapness-- \\n * I hated -- and I mean HATED -- most of the supporting characters. Wereterrier-boy, Sandra Dee Ghost-girl, the Asian geeks, the Vampire chicks, the Corporation Monster Hunters -- they all sucked the life out of the story. When things were focused on Gwen, things were great. I loved her digging up and eating brains. I loved her having to cope with the memories of the brains she's eaten. I loved her learning what she really is from Amon. I loved her whenever she was on her own. But when she was surrounded by her pack of idiot friends, it was like being stuck in a supernatural Riverdale High. \\n * I was not impressed with Laura Allred's colours. In fact, I think her colouring work wrecked Michael Allred's pencils. Compare and contrast the black and white work in the back with the glossy, fully coloured panels of the graphic novel. The depth and texture is suddenly missing, and it makes the M. Allred's drawings look like cheap, low-budget TV animation. Granted, there are some bits that her colours can't ruin, but most of it was ruined for me. \\n * I fucking hate Jughead and anything that reminds me of him! Have I mentioned that Gwen's friends are a pack of Riverdale rejects?\"),\n",

       "  'Cold Day in Hell (130-133). I\\'m not convinced that this first story was meant to be about McCoy. It features the Doctor and Frobisher still angsting about Peri leaving, then Frobisher leaving himself. As such, it would have worked much better in continuity as a Colin Baker story set after Trial of a Time Lord. With that said, this is still a cool story because it has the Ice Warriors -- even if we\\'ve seen most of the ideas before, like a group of Ice Warriors going rogue because they don\\'t like peace and them making a planet particularly cold. I also appreciated the continuity with the Galactic Federation, which continues right on into the next story [7/10]. \\n Redemption! (134). The idea of a companion gone bad is a good one, but it\\'s all a bit sudden and thus the story is pretty shallow [6/10]. \\n The Crossroads of Time (135). A battle between the Doctor and Death\\'s Head is a cool bit of fun, especially as it\\'s a pivotal event in Death\\'s Head\\'s chronology. Unfortunately, the continuity of this story as a Doctor Who offering is awful with a \"Time Warden\" who watches the paths of time and the Doctor willing to try and kill Death\\'s Head almost instantly [4/10]. \\n Claws of the Klathi (136-138). What an entirely bizarre strip, with some convoluted and irrelevant backstory and a whole bit with aliens traveling as a freak show. I didn\\'t find it very interesting, nor did I find this Seventh Doctor very dark, despite the author\\'s claims to the contrary. The story did have some great Victorian setting, but that wasn\\'t enough to make it good [5/10]. \\n Culture Shock! (139). Grant Morrison\\'s story is fun just because it imagines a totally weird SF idea [8/10]. \\n Keepsake (140). This story is really shallow, but fun for how it shows the Doctor being both silly (like the early 7) and also manipulating someone into doing something for him (like the late 7) [6/10]. \\n Planet of the Dead (141-142). So this story has old companions and old Doctors, introduced for the purpose of an anniversary, but used really, really shallowly. Despite that, it\\'s fun, especially in the interactions between the Doctors, which is spot on. The relation to the history of the Whifferdils is fun too [7/10]. \\n Echoes of the Morgor! (143-144). Nice to have Abnett writing a story. This one is as thin as most of the stories in this volume, but still offers up an interesting mystery that\\'s fun to read. However the old memories imprinted on crystals feels very overused, especially since it appeared in the \"Dragonsfire\" episode right around the same time [6/10]. \\n Time & Tide (145-146). There\\'s very little depth to this story, which is all about fate, the inevitable, and aliens having the Doctor for supper. There\\'s meant to be some humor here, but it\\'s not enough to keep the story rolling [5/10]. \\n Follow that TARDIS (147). This is a pretty silly strip too, but at least it\\'s actually funny at times. I also appreciated seeing the Meddling Monk again, and I think his use is right in line with that from the \\'60s [6/10]. \\n Invaders from Gantac! (148-150). This last strip felt a lot like some of the early DWM strips, and I think that\\'s the 2000AD influence. It\\'s overall an interesting, fast-moving story, somewhat let down by a silly ending where fleas save the day [6/10]. \\n Unfortunately, as a whole I found this a pretty lack-luster volume. As I said, it\\'s often shallow. I also only occasionally got a good sense of McCoy\\'s Doctor, sometimes the clown of the early seasons, and maybe once the schemer of the last season and the New Adventures. This problem was worse in the earlier stories, and may be the result of the authors not yet having seen 7 in action. \\n I also didn\\'t like the fact that the Doctor was mostly solo and that there\\'s almost no continuity between the strips, making it all around pretty blah. I suspect the rotating cast of writers contributed to that.'),\n",

I have liked most that I have read, but they don\\'t cross my path very often. I picked this one up because I read an announcement that Yang had been chosen by the Library of Congress as the fifth national ambassador for young people\\'s literature. Since I am interested in literacy, education and reading, but did not know anything about Yang, I thought it would be a good idea for me to read one of his books. \\n Serendipity makes for interesting reading and this was no exception. American Born Chinese was available at my local branch library, so I picked this novel by Yang. He does a great job of writing about his own experience and making it accessible to readers who have felt uncomfortable with their environment. I think there are many young adults that could relate to Jin Wang\\'s desires to fit in and his ways of coping with being an outsider. \\n Yang himself sounds like an interesting man. When he accepted the role as ambassador he said, \"Reading breaks down the walls that divide us. By reading, we get to know people outside of our own communities. We gain knowledge others don\\'t expect us to have. We discover new and surprising passions. Reading is critical to our growth, both as individuals and as a society.\" (https://www.loc.gov/today/pr/2016/16-...) \\n I recommend this book to anyone interested in getting to know people outside their own community.

       "  \"The Innocence of Nihilism (1-7). This is an amazing first volume. I love the structure of the book, with its kaleidoscope focus on some many characters in some many timeframes. More than once I found myself flipping back and forth to make sure I understood the connections. The storytelling is also very strong, with most of the issues ending with rather shocking moments of the sort that a more traditional comic would be afraid to include, because they'd create too much change. \\n With that all said, it's the characters that really make the volume. In particular, this is Ginny's story, as she's beset by too many young tragedy. However, we also get an interesting focus on Joey (and his mother Rose.) As we see this young people grow up, it's easy to reflect upon what we learn by what we see. \\n The one issue I didn't love was #6, with Amy Racecar. It's a wacky and violent future story that only gains context when you realize that it must be a story written by Ginny. Read in that context, it has some additional weight (and even sets up some things in issue #7). \\n Overall a very readable and rereadable comic! [10/10] \\n Somewhere Out West (8-14). Not nearly as strong as the first volume, primarily because it focuses on a much more linear story. Still, it gains weight as the story goes on, to the point where the last (50 page!) story is tense & otherwise brilliant. The way that various characters come together is excellent & Ginnie offers some fun metatextuality. Overall, this is still quite an enjoyable read. [7/10] \\n Other People (15-22). I was happy to see a return to the fragmented storytelling of volume 1, but this volume just doesn't have the same heft. I think there's a lot of factors in this: there's not as much crime and not as much shock; the stories are less connected; and there's no particular finale. Nonetheless, these were more enjoyable stories to read, thanks primarily to the characters and to the delightfully terrible situations they end up in [7-/10]. \\n Dark Days (23-30). This is a nice composite of Lapham's earlier styles. Like Somewhere Out West (#2) it tells a cohesive story and like The Innocence of Nihilism (#1) it plays with structure and time. But it combines the two methodologies. The result is the strongest volume of Stray Bullets since the original. There are great characters here and (more importantly) great tension. The result is lovely (and leaves many of our characters in states where we want to know more about what happens to them!). [8/10] \\n Hi-Jinks & Derry-Do (31-41). A rather surprising return to normalcy, though it's obvious from the start that Ginnie's no longer up for the normal world (and that's part of the delight of this arc). Lapham continues to play with form, sometimes with great success (in Ginny's diary story which parallels much of the other action), and sometimes less so (in the hearing aid story, which doesn't feel dramatic because it's so over the top). [7/10] \\n Overall, this is a pretty great comic, and it's great to read it through from cover to cover, to see all of the interrelations. Lapham has never regained the breezy style of interrelating characters that he pioneered in the first volume, but the stories continue to be addictively readable.\"),\n",

Everything has been a joy to read -- even the hopeless and depressing books I\\'ve been reading -- and late last night, with the kids all in bed and Erika on nights at the hospital, I started to read one of my rare \"first reads\" wins in earnest, only to stay up until Kiss and Tell was finished, which took me into the wee wee hours before sunrise. \\n Raw, courageous, honest, funny, tormented and true, MariNaomi\\'s graphic memoir is pure joy. \\n MariNaomi is a woman who lives in the life she\\'s got. She wears her life like tattered old jeans, lovingly repairing the holes with multi-coloured patches that offer a Levi Strauss tapestry of experience, making the jeans far more valuable than any crisp, unworn pair could ever be. \\n I have a confession: I am in love with MariNaomi. I wish I\\'d had a chance to know her when we were teenagers, but we were separated by 1,618 km. I wish I\\'d had the chance to snort coke with her, or make love to her, or hold her head while she puked up too much alcohol, or experiment with open relationships with, or bring her flowers, or write her poetry, or have her write poetry to me, or kiss her anywhere or anywhen she wanted. Kiss and Tell made me want to be part of her life and experience so badly that I nearly cried when it was over. And I wanted more. I still want more. I want MariNaomi to give me another glimpse, a glimpse of her years from 23-37. Please, please, please, MariNaomi. I\\'ll make you a mix tape. I promise. \\n I have another wish, impossible like all my other wishes, but I wish that I\\'d had this graphic novel as a teenage boy. It would have shed so much light for me on the world of the girls I loved and lusted after. I think, somehow, that Kiss and Tell would have taken the sting out of breakups and unrequited love and all the painful trials and errors; it could have made me a Zen teenager, enjoying without regret or bitterness or self-loathing my time brushing up against the girls of my life, and it would have made it so much easier to brush up against the boys I kept away too. \\n I wish all first reads books could be like this.

Bear with me here... \\n So there are stories that are set in the past and- wasn't it just awful? Women were treated like second class citizens! I'm so outraged! And we must watch, with growing weariness, as the plucky woman gets knocked down over and over, and rises up time and again (because what type of feminist story would it be if she didn't? She must be Strong Female Character TM). \\n Then there are stories set in today's world that make us aware (or affirm what we know to be true) of the shit women experience today, that make us think of how far we've come, perhaps, but also how large the gulf still is between here and true equality. \\n There are stories set in the future, like Bitch Planet, that frame women's position in society as just a tenuous, or often even moreso because of the omnipresent fascist dictatorship, just in a different way. \\n But then lastly, and much, much more rarely, are stories like this. Stories that take women out of the context of inequity and injustice altogether, that do not look at us in the context of where we fit in relation to men. Stories that pose us as the center, that make us the default. That make tears rise in our eyes when we realize for a moment the true extent, even after SO. MUCH. WORK., of our own internalized misogyny, because to see us at the center, to see all barriers removed, to see us have the true extent of personhood, of moral ambiguity, of strength and weakness, of sexual reserve or freedom, feels so strange even at the same time that it feels fucking amazing. \\n Because this is not simply a genderbent version of the Odyssey. Zeus, here a woman (and a FAT woman at that) has destroyed all the men in the universe to protect her position at the top. There are a few men and boys here and there but they are very rare, making all of the main characters women- women who fight and love and screw with full independence and agency. \\n A straight genderswap would still have been a reflection of what is. We would still be mentally converting men to women and women to men, still operating within the same narrative. The same power structures would exist, and then what would be the POINT? \\n So this- this is what I love about Ody-C. It is one of those few stories that allow us to imagine something outside the narrative we've always known, whether we recognize it consciously or unconsciously.

His main goal is to murder Ronald Reagan (this takes place in the 80s obviously) who he blames for his parent\\'s death. \\n It is less Hogwart\\'s for assassins than I expected. In fact, almost none of the story is actually in the school, which was a little bit of a disappointment, to be honest.

       "  'With extreme reluctance, I came down quite harshly on the first few volumes of Earth 2. I am a massive Robinson fan, considering his Starman possibly the best superhero series of the last few decades (yes I am THAT big of a fan). Earth 2 began with premise containing considerable promise. A huge fan of Elseworld titles, I liked the idea of an earth recovering from a Great War with Darkseid\\'s minions which claimed \"the big three.\" (Let me take this moment for an aside to b*tch about DC\\'s terrible mistake in retconing away Wildstorm\\'s bold choice to crash their entire universe in a still darker apocalypse. Rant ends here). Unfortunately, Earth 2\\'s early volumes never lived up to their promise. Instead of giving us interesting takes on familiar characters, Robinson just gave us wholly different people who happen to have the same names. Moreover, the story meandered. We never got to know anybody well enough to care about their fate. At the same time, even hardy readers eventually lose patience with suggested secrets that come to nothing in a book near devoid of action or stakes. Tom Taylor didn\\'t just correct these shortcomings, he attacked them with a pitiless vengeance. Vol 4, dripping in action, stakes, and excitement is a case-in-point. \\n If you\\'re not familiar with Taylor, he also writes DC\\'s other great all universe on-going elseworld, \"Injustice\" (I know, it\\'s a based on a game. Rom and Micronauts were based on toys and were awesome. Put aside your prejudice and check it out). Taylor\\'s two titles contain a few common tropes and plot points, but at the same time are distinct, each a thrill in its own right. \\n I\\'ll maintain my usual commitment to avoid spoilers and give you a quick plot sketch. The dead, it seems are coming back. Superman, thought killed by the forces of Darkseid, is back as the Dark God\\'s thrall. He\\'s raining murder and destruction all over the world. Meanwhile Batman, who died with Superman, is also back. He is also far darker, wielding a gun. The reveal here is delicious and hard to resist, but trust me, it is a bit of brilliance on Taylor\\'s part. So Apokolips is waging war on earth with Superman leading his forces, and a maniacal gun-wielding Batman seems to be the only hope. What more do you need to know? \\n On a side note, I must put in a word for the truly amazing art in this book. Scott\\'s work is so well suited to this story, it as if she was born to it. Rich lines, vivid detail, emotional punch all combine here beautifully. I read this as an ebook which really detracted from the splash pages and will now buy it as a volume.

Each of the books published has a detailed story, wonderful characters, and amazing artwork. So, it was no surprise that I jumped at the opportunity to read Naifeh's newest work, Princess Ugg. \\n Princess Ugg: Volume 1 introduces readers to the rough and tumble, yet lovable Princess Ulga of the Grimmerians (who are like Vikings but with a thick accent). Princess Ulga's mother passed away, but before she did she asked her daughter to try and find an alternative solution for the war with the Frost Giants. Ulga feels that she can stop the war, but only if she becomes a true princess. To become a true princess, she travels to a prestigious princess school where she hopes to find the answers she seeks. \\n The graphic novel details Ulga's struggles to fit in with the other girls and to work to stop the upcoming war. It isn't an easy path Ulga has chosen, but it is one that may prove helpful and valuable in the long run. The other princesses mock her, play mean tricks on her, and refuse to allow her to become a part of their prestigious groups. \\n When I first started reading Princess Ugg, it was a bit difficult. The characters talk with an almost Scottish brogue and there was a talking raven who spoke in a mythology-like tone. The two different writing styles almost had me giving up, but this graphic novel really hit its stride about 25% of the way into it and I absolutely fell in love with it. \\n The outline and summary of Princess Ugg may make it sound like just your average rough girl turns pretty princess story, but it really isn't. Naifeh puts his own unique twist on this standard tale and really makes it his own. It is packed with humor that isn't over the top or absurd, adventure, and a great plot. \\n The entire story surrounding Princess Ugg may not be overly unique or complex, but it has that special take that really makes a reader love the characters. By the end of the story, I was hooked and can't wait to read more. I think what finally 'hooked' me on this story was that it isn't your average graphic novel.

       "  'In the great debate regarding DC\\'s decision to launch \"Before Watchmen,\" I remain a committed agnostic. Yes, Moore and Gibson\\'s creations are unique, perhaps not only for their place in the evolution of the comic art form, but also as characters meant to occupy a singular storyline and go no further. And yes, one should understandably fear the possibility - hyperbole intentional - of these stories reading like \"Hamlet - the Prequel.\" Yet characters passing from one creative team to another lays at the very DNA of superhero comics, part of what makes it a form unlike any other. After all, Moore and Gibson originally imagined their story populated by the Charlton Comics\\' characters (The Question, Blue Beatle, Captain Atom, etc) before deciding on thinly altered cast all their own. Do you feel like Moore \"violated\" Wojtkowsi and Ditko? Just as Kirby and Shuster\\'s Captain America passed into Brubaker\\'s loving hands, should The Minutemen be any different? \\n One big caveat remains: new isn\\'t always better. Nobody cares if some terrible writer becomes the next in line taking up the pen on Batgirl and does nothing interesting; if you are the second writer to take on Ozymandias, you\\'d better have something interesting to say. So how is \"Before Watchmen: The Minutemen & Silk Spectre\"? Not only is this the best volume of a decidedly mixed enterprise, it is also a surprisingly engaging read. \\n Cooke begins with a rather obvious choice: telling this story through the eyes of the First Nite Owl and his tell-all, \"Under the Hood.\" He then pulls off a brilliant hat trick, combing through Moore & Gibson\\'s original and presenting a Nite Owl who is about to reveal not just one former colleague\\'s secret, but all their secrets. Nor does he stop there. Where other books in this series offer pedestrian motivations for why this or that character donned the mask, Cooke dives deep and surfaces with gold. One need only compare his portrait of the Comedian with that offered in the anti-hero\\'s own book to recognize his success. Where that book\\'s author, the often talented Brian Azzarello, chooses to white wash the Comedian\\'s murderous inclination, here we see the character as a full on sociopath, robbing with abandon, beating the innocent, and still worse. \\n Cooke further looks at a range of social topics and plays with a grab-bag of comic tropes. Others in \"Before Watchmen\" have flushed out otherwise minor characters. Cooke goes the furthest, taking one otherwise given scant lines and a frame or two in the original and crafting a deep and moving view of a hero driven by her demons. The Silhouette stands out as the best character in the prequel series. For her alone, this a book well worth your time. Where Moore\\'s original bifurcated Batman between Rorschach and Nite Owl, Cooke shatters the Dark Knight and reflects his various aspects in the shards. \\n Cooke\\'s art also stands out. Now I don\\'t share some critics\\' preference for writer/artists over team efforts. Both are fine with me. Still, Cooke\\'s Kirby influenced style which was so beautifully featured in DC\\'s \"The New Frontier\" proves perfect for \"The Minutemen.\" \"New Frontier\" looked at the passing of the torch from the Golden to the Silver age; this book could well be seen as the passing of a curse. Either way, it proves marvelous. \\n \"Silk Spectre\" of course is a different animal all together. Despite being pivotal character in Moore & Gibson\\'s original, of the series that make up \"Before Watchmen\" this would surely have been many fans bet on the one with the least potential. Again, Cooke surprises. Instead of playing up the heroic comic book motifs, he offers a powerful examination of a complex web of relationship: mother-daughter, daughter-father, girl-boy (and along the way takes what I can only assume is a swipe at Moore by offering a less than salutary take on drug culture and hallucinogenic). Just as \"Watchmen\" explored its own alternate history, so Cooke takes us to an alternate version of 1960\\'s San Francisco. As in Moore, Laurie is very much a character fleeing a burden that her mother seeks to thrust upon her We see Laurie struggle with the super hero training received from her mother (who is wonderfully painted as sympathetic, complex, AND bats&*t crazy) and her desire to live. And it is that inner desire which shines on the page. . And here Amanda Connors\\' art as much makes the story as any word on the page. \\n For \"Silk Spectre,\" Cooke smartly puts his own artist brush aside and hands the reigns over to Connors. Her work her goes above and beyond anything I\\'ve seen from her previously. Here her work is neither so \"cartoonish,\" nor as Manga touched. Instead she favors crisper lines and more subtle color. Connors moves to a wholly style for the cells when we leap into Laurie\\'s mind to see visual representations of her inner life. \\n If you are a reader thinking of picking up just part of \"Before Watchmen\" there really is no competition. \"Minutemen/Silk Spectre\" is the volume that won\\'t leave you asking yourself why with regards to the entire enterprise. If every book were as smart and thoughtful and this, \"Before Watchmen\" would have become a legend, rather than footnote.'),\n",

       "  'This book is mostly a superset of the Absolom Daak, Dalek Killer book from 1990. Though this book is about twice the size of the original book, it doesn\\'t have much additional value. That\\'s because it\\'s filled with Marvel\\'s ill-conceived attempt to create really shallow Doctor Who comics for kids. This is one of those situations where I can\\'t even thank Panini for being thorough and giving us all the strips, because there\\'s almost no value in the material from Hulk magazine. \\n Nemesis of the Daleks (152-155). The return of the Daleks and Daak Dalek Killer was pretty monumental, and this strip makes good use of them. Though Daak sadly meets his end, he goes out killing Daleks. \\n However, this isn\\'t a very good 7th Doctor story. He plays second fiddle during most of the story. His only good character moment is when he\\'s willing to sacrifice himself to end the death wheel threat. I was particularly surprised by the lack of substantive follow-up to Remembrance of the Daleks (season 25; where Seven destroyed Skaro). However, the rest of the attention to Dalek continuity was great. We get daleks and ogrons and a dalek emperor who is implied to be Davros. Very cool stuff. \\n [8/10] \\n Stairway to Heaven (156). A pretty meh story, as the Doctor Who strip just isn\\'t at its best in single-issue stories, especially when the Doctor is companion-less. Unfortunately, this was a sign of things to come ... [5/10]. \\n The Hulk (1-12, some reprinted in DWM 157-158), Doctor Konquerer! (DWM 162). These Hulk stories (which include two issues that were reprinted in DWM and one issue that appeared only in DWM) were intended for kids, and it shows. They\\'re short at 4-5 pages, and they\\'ve very shallow. A few are barely saved by last-minute twists and by nice continuity, but it\\'s not enough to make them worth reading [4/10]. \\n Train-Flight (159-161). From the perspective of the 7th Doctor\\'s continuity, it\\'s nice to finally get a reference to Ace, suggesting that the comics might link up with the TV show soon. From the perspective of overall Who continuity, this is nice also for the return of Sarah Jane Smith. It great to see Seven still guilty about sending her away, and if this story doesn\\'t actually match the canon of later novels (Bullet Time) or TV shows (\"School Reunion\") about Sarah Jane ... ah well. As for the story itself: it\\'s OK. We\\'d see the stolen public transit motif again both in the New Adventures books (Highest Science) and in the modern TV show (\"Planet of the Dead\"). Other than that, there\\'s a bit of to-do made about why so many aliens like the earth, which is a set-up for the next volume ... and it\\'s a relief to see continuity developing again in the comic strip [5/10]. \\n And that\\'s all of the Seventh Doctor that appears in Nemesis of the Daleks. There\\'s a great story (\"Nemesis\"), a so-so story with some interesting elements (\"Train-Flight\"), and a bunch of stuff I wish they hadn\\'t even reprinted (all the stories that originated with Hulk magazine.) \\n That\\'s not the end of the volume, though, because it also reprints the classic Daak stories: \\n Abslom Daak, Dalek Killer (17-20). This is a delightful little story. The action is good (and full of Dalek killing), but there\\'s also great characterization and tragedy. It\\'s also neat to see the setup of a future history, something that would be developed much more in the New Adventures. [7/10]. \\n Star Tigers (27-30, 44-46). These stories don\\'t have the same action-adventure thrill as the original Daak stories, but they do a great job of putting together a fun team of adventurers. Sadly, the team never really gets used (and then is dealt with poorly in \"Nemesis\"). Ah well. Such is the world of periodicals, sometimes [6+/10]. \\n The only thing missing that appeared in the Abslom Daak book is a prose short story that bridged the two strips and was quite bad, so no loss there. \\n Now whether Nemesis of the Daleks as a book is an improvement over the Daak book is a different question. All of the Daak material here is great, but the only other thing (sort of) worth reading is the Seven and Sarah Jane story. Then there\\'s piles of trash. I replaced my Daak volume with this because this volume matches the other Panini volumes. \\n I gave this book 3 stars out of 5, balancing good Daak and bad Hulk.'),\n",

This four issue collected edition chronicles Tino\\'s initial adventures interspersed with his daily responsibilities as a caring husband. \\n An old man who can singlehandedly throw trucks? Awesome idea. But the main thesis of \"what can an old superman do\" seemed to be underutilized throughout the story. This can be mainly attributed to the lack of character depth. While the panels with his wife Aura felt sincere and while Tino\\'s conversations with the trusty tanod are entertaining enough to make you smile, their monotonic roles bored me. Worse, it took toll on Tino\\'s character in a sense that the lack of character depth can make one feel that the main hero could be just anyone. At least the cliffhanger end provided promising fates for these two supporting characters. \\n It is good that the main antagonist after this prologue volume is still more shrouded than exposed, and I can\\'t wait to see how this group is connected with Mang Tino\\'s discovery of his own superhuman strength. \\n The cliched superhero moments are forgiveable because of the smooth execution and often hilarious ways they are seen in the panels. One can obviously see some Batman and Spidey elements in the book (where I love the 90s action Eddie Garcia-ish vigilante style but absolutely hate the New York Yankees cap). Ian Sta.

I'll try to be constructive here. I got it free for review. \\n Starting with the art. In the back of the book the artist said he wants it to show as hand drawn, and it clearly is that. I understand his motive, but this looked more like the sketches, or a storyboard, of the comic than the final work. The black and white drawn look is fine if that's the direction they want to go, but there were times I couldn't tell what I was even looking at. There just wasn't a good enough definition of line. Sometimes the artist went overboard with shading and attempt at detail and it just ended up muddy. The work is amateurish in the figure drawing and often they look quite stiff. I'm guessing he was drawing from ideas rather than from reference. \\n Some of the paneling was good and unique and there were occasional panels with good shifts in perspective. I'm not sure if the artist did the lettering, but placement of speech bubbles was occasionally difficult to follow. \\n Actually, the art somewhat reminded me of the book From Hell by Moore. I don't recall the artist on that one, but I hated it. This art might actually be somewhat of an improvement over that. \\n The writing - while the idea and overall plot of the book was ok, and the pacing was decent, the dialogue was just not very natural. The characters were pretty stereotypical and thin. The author mentioned his favorite character was Buck. I think he was actually my least favorite character as he was just so overly cheezy. \\n One suggestion to the author would be to use the method of show, not tell. Direct the artist in a way to show how something works, or progress plot through images only, or similar things where there are less words on the page. Use the comic medium for what it is. \\n I liked how, especially toward the end, the story changes from characters to characters when they are separated. Actually, overall, I'd say the last 1/3rd of the book was the best part. \\n This review was more directed toward the creators and, if they read this, hopefully they can take the criticism as constructive and improve their work. I think they have potential and with improvements, and an editor perhaps (there were also quite a few typos and errors), they could eventually get a good book.

Nolan's 'Monster Island' project was actually first published in the 90's and has been re-released for a new audience. \\n The story harkens back to comics from a decade plus back as this was pure fun, it was not dark and ugly as most comics are these days.

I did want to read more about Ayano and Yuuto, I do believe that the story ended a bit too soon. Nevertheless, those ten chapters brought fourth a lot of amazing emotions. It may seem that the story is not that unique, but I loved it every time I read it. And I've read it at least 4 times. Every time I read it I find myself astonished as if I'm reading it very first time. \\n Let's get back to the story. The main character Ayano, who is the class president one morning after the baseball game after-party, finds herself half-naked near her classmate Yuuto Kagura. Well, everything could have been great, but Yuuto is the 10th head of the Mafia. Shortly, he's one scary guy and everyone in class is afraid of him. But what happened between those two? Ayano doesn't remember anything, and Yuuto is the only one who knows what has happened the night before. Yuuto asks Ayano to kiss him, otherwise he will tell everyone what has happened between those two. However, Ayano finds herself attracted to Yuuto and somehow they end up going out. But will everything be that easy? \\n The story has a lot of romance and action. Yuuto makes your heart race every time you look at him. You just wish such guy was real and at your side. The story progresses really fast and it is at one side amazing, but on the other really bad, because you just don't want to say goodbye to your favourite characters. Yuuto may seem like a bad guy, but the more you read about him, the more you fall in love with him. Ayano is another great character. She is both strong and fragile at the same time. Her faith and love in Yuuto is something amazing to read about. The story has a lot of fun moments as well as the heartbreaking ones. The fun parts are sometimes laced with black humor, but you just can't hold laughter when you read those moments. There are a lot of moments when Ayano and Yuuto were on the verge of break up, and every time those moments are really heartbreaking. But they always find how to solve their problems. \\n I hope you will take up this manga to read and will fins it as enjoyable as I did. You will love it from the first page to the last one. You'll definitely wish there was a bit more to read about the characters you just met.

       "  \"The second volume of Marv Wolfman's New Teen Titans continues to show the heavy character basis of the first -- something that was largely unknown in the DC comics at the time. Where Raven was the center of the first volume, this time around it's Changeling and Donna Troy. \\n Changeling is the biggest star, because his plot threads through the standalones featuring Puppeteer and Deathstroke (#9-10), his injury causes the Titans to go to Paradise Island (#11-12), then his plot again takes center stage in the Hunt for the Killers of the Doom Patrol arc (#13-15). \\n Unfortunately, the first few issues are a bit weak. It's interesting to see Gar as the (very) reluctant business owner, which adds a bit of depth to his character. The antics about his company's Promethium never seems to go anywhere though, and the Puppeteer isn't a very interesting foe. The Deathstroke issue is better, because he's been powered up, and we can see him rising to the fore as a major foe for the Titans. But that's more of a matter of historical interest than actual good storytelling. \\n Fortunately, the Hunt for the Killers of the Doom Patrol that ends Gar's arc is quite a good story. It's nice to see some closure for Rogue and Zahl, and to see what Gar is willing to do to avenge his friends and mother. The introduction of the New Brotherhood is also terrific; they're another of Wolfman's finest creations. And as for the Doom Patrol themselves: they get a nice send-off that likely is also what introduced them to many modern readers, and led to Morrison's terrific take on them. \\n The Donna Troy plot (#11-12) focuses on the Titans of Myth (Cronus and his kin) freeing themselves from Tartarus. It's pretty great from a mythological perspective, and it's equally great to see the Titans of Myth and the gods of Mount Olympus becoming major actors in the story of Paradise Island. It's easy to see how this influenced artist George Perez in his own reinvention of Wonder Woman a few years down the road. \\n However, it's a mediocre story beyond that, focused on lots of fighting, much of it between Titans and gods and Amazons, not our main characters. It's also a pretty awful Donna Troy spotlight because she is robbed of her agency by a mind-controlling god and spends most of the two issues as a thrall. (Though we get a brief reminder that she doesn't know who her parent are, as a plot arc for the future.) Even moreso than the Deathstroke issue, I consider these arc to contain great ideas that were lacking in the execution. \\n The last issue in this volume (#16) is really a mini-Starfire spotlight, and it's a great one, focusing on who she is and how far she's willing to go. (But we'll have to wait until volume 4 to get her major story arc.) Meanwhile, Wolfman does a great job of advancing the lives of his other characters too. \\n Overall, volume 2 of the Titans feels weaker than volume 1. There's still a lot of great invention and reinvention, but only the Doom Patrol arc and the Starblaze single issue shine as much as the heights of volume 1. Meanwhile, the Promethium and Titans of Mythology arcs were a lot more meh. Still, this is innovative stuff that's still quite interesting in the modern day.\"),\n",

It is crazy, unordered, with so many wrong things in it. Hell, it is all wrong in the most explicit, boombastic and explosive ways. It defies the bounds of graphic literature. It may even be a topic for academic discourse and dissertations. \\n But this is a mainstream Batman comic written by a well-respected writer which is a direct follow-up to an age-defining, best-selling The Dark Knight Returns. So all I can say is: WHAT THE HELL DID I JUST READ? \\n Ohh, DK2 is wrong in all levels I can think of, in any dimension, story-wise and on technical elements. This is not even a Dark Knight story. It is a convoluted DC JSA-ish book. In each page, I wonder what the eff is going inside Frank Miller\\'s mind. Is this a flick-of-a-finger joke to his fans and DC comics or did he simply lost his mind? The story is non-coherent and very poorly paced.

       "  \"This is an excellent, if very NSFW and often nerdish, account of the graphic illustration of sex up until the late 1970s. \\n Much of the background to this era has already been covered in a series of book reviews elsewhere in GoodReads. We direct you to our sexuality and erotica list with special reference to McDonough's biography of Russ Meyer and to the Taschen edition of Men's Adventure covers. \\n The review of Gillian Freeman's 'Undergrowth of Literature' (written in the 1960s) and Paul Willetts' biography of Paul Raymond add a British perspective. You can read all these and more at http://www.goodreads.com/review/list/... \\n Lavishly illustrated, this is not a book to leave lying around the house if the vicar or a sheltered maiden aunt is coming to tea but the sexual representation is only half the story. The other half is what this material says about repressed male desire during a sexual dark age. \\n We see the role of war and the failure of mainstream entertainment to offer a realistic model for sexual relations when Hollywood, literature and advertising offered only a sensualised romanticism (at most), one that seemed constantly geared to female aspiration and a presumed male gentility. \\n The First World War and its aftermath appear to have allowed some form of male sexual expression that was not entirely vicious (though the Tijuana Bibles were scarcely kind, women appeared to be allowed a sexuality of their own) but this was crushed with the new puritanism of the 1930s. \\n What we think of as sexism probably reached its highest point from the 1930s to the 1970s when a repressive public morality shifted its gaze from alcohol suppression to sexual conduct, not for the first time in American history. \\n American puritanism is and always has been a deep neurosis in the American soul. Neither the British nor the Europeans were ever quite so obsessed with sexual rectitude, a position that still affects the rhetoric of politics in the three worlds today. \\n There is no doubt that this deliberate repression of both male and female desire resulted in an inability for honest dialogue between the sexes to take place, whose worst manifestations were female lack of fulfilment and a male rage that erotic comics fully expressed. \\n The objectifying pin-ups of the period were often delightful (there is reference to them here) but this book is about comics. Comics in America could be deeply unpleasant in their misogyny and in their attitude towards women as not objects of desire but objects of use, almost alien artefacts. \\n It might be said that, by denying the instinctive need of both sexes to be objects of desire (as the French do so well), Anglo-Saxon culture turned men and women into opposing forces who were obliged to see each other in terms solely of their use-value. \\n The result was a suppressed rage and hatred in some quarters - an entrapment of women that led to a vicious feminist reaction that would crush male desire further and a misogyny that became the blokish way of surviving sadness and a sense of loss of manhood under a feminising culture. \\n This degenerate farce of Judaeo-Christian misery was compounded by war. War (as we have seen in the case of Russ Meyer) liberated men to think new thoughts about comradeship and sex but the women of a defeated or dislocated Europe had presented a contradiction to the expectations of the home front. \\n Women went from relatively free spirits in the 1920s through the experience of war work to enforced domestic slavery just as men were returning to a mythic homeland of Norman Rockwell domesticity that was endorsed by magazines, churches, anti-communist politicians and advertisers. \\n Neither the women nor the men stood a chance against the dead weight of 'normality' where sexuality was presumed to be deviant if not straight, where women were supposed to be passive lest they become rapacious and a real man had to be a chivalrous (in public) brute (in private). \\n These comics represent a superb guide not to female but to male alienation. It might good for women to see this book not in order to lambast men as misogynistic apes (a first reaction) but to ask what it is that makes men want this cruel humour since most do not want it now. \\n Many of the cartoons (in particular) express a paradox - the women are strong and emasculating. The men may have formal power but they are psychologically weak, putty in the hands of feminine sexual power or what is now called their erotic capital. The misogyny is linked to weakness and fear. \\n The dominance of fetish and bondage imagery (represented in the pin-up sector by the now oddly charming and innocent representations of Betty Page), if for only small minorities of the male public in practice, constantly remind us that many males were fetishised by their condition. \\n One trope is the strong and frightening female - Wonder Woman was the creation of such an acknowledged fetishist - crushing the will or body of a weaker girlish figure in an avowedly sado-masochistic lesbian relationship. \\n Where is the male here. He is not just observer but secret participant. He has become the woman in a fantasy of revenge where the powerful are brought into play to bring to heel the 'feminine' that oppresses through subtle means that confuse a male who has no language for what is happening to him. \\n The situation changes again with the 1960s. The 'sexual liberation' took rather a long time to work through the culture, certainly for women. The first fruits were in popular culture where Playboy, then Penthouse, developed a gentler pornography until Hustler returned to old misogynistic ways. \\n To an extent, the last part of the book shows a culture that allowed liberation to mean merely the more effective artistic licensing of cruelty, although, in Europe, the bondage culture shifts gear into a type of sado-masochistic eroticism that is so fantastic as to become appealing to women. \\n It is often women who lap up the Sadean 'Histoire d'O' because we see a reversal of the 'Wonder Woman' theme of revolt against submission. In modern female eroticism, women are seeking the fantasy of safe submission because they miss the romantic strength of the male. \\n It is not that men have become 'wimps' but that they have no longer a sphere (war and industry) where they were strong so that they came home to a feminised environment but from a presumed masculine culture where their strength could be presumed (or their failure despised). \\n The whole elite world has become partially feminised (not entirely since women have learned 'male strength' in the public sphere) but the men have given up without much of a fight, perhaps almost with relief at not having to fight any longer. \\n There is a point in the late 1970s where you can see the seeds of what will become sex-positive feminism, something reaching out to the world we have today where it is women as much as men who decide the nature of erotic representation at the smarter end of popular culture. \\n It has to be said that there are some very sick and deviant minds present in this book, much darker than the relatively benign Russ Meyer and Paul Raymond. On the other hand, there is some genuine humour and some genuine eroticism and beauty but it is a long way from Violet Blue and Coco de Mer. \\n What this excellently produced and detailed account tells us is that these erotic and pornographic comics were reflections of a very mentally disturbed mid-twentieth century culture that, it must not be forgotten, coped with two world wars and human slaughter on an industrial scale. \\n We Anglo-Saxons may still not have resolved ourselves into a civilised stance on desire and transgression but at least the two sexes are talking to each other and allowing space for phantasy and (despite feminist idiocy) mutual objectification. The cruelty is proportionately disappearing. \\n It is to be hoped that our current troubles do not turn us back to those days of repression. Sadly, a malign alliance of faith-based groups and progressive feminism against sex workers and male desire suggests that the seeds of a new hell are in the making. \\n The fact that Google has foolishly directed funds towards faith-based groups involved in the sex-trafficking lobby (according to SWAAY) should fill us all with trepidation that the new capitalism will follow the old capitalism into making alliances with the devil. \\n Now a word for the British who get honourable mentions not only as providing some fine artists but for wartime contributions like 'Jane' and the comic seaside postcards of the persecuted Donald McGill, lauded by no less than George Orwell. \\n The authorities here were pragmatic about sexuality, seeking to contain it when it was disruptive, mobilise it (as did the American military) when it was useful and ignore it when it was harmless and hidden. Social mores did the rest in that way the British have of ignoring troublesome things. \\n This did not mean that sexual life was any less painful and repressed than in America but at least it was enforced by something closer to a Japanese style of mutual conformity - a shame culture - rather than the unpleasant guilt culture perpetrated on Americans by puritan miserabilism. \\n In America, that beacon of light and idealism, there was always some organising lobby for 'decency' with a hold on the political process who would add ideology to the pot. Sexually, America was a cesspit trying to pretend that it was an ornamental lake. \\n It was not only sex, American attitudes to alcohol, drugs and gambling are and were much the same. Somewhere there is always a schoolmistress or a priest or a politician trying to tell people in the land of the free how to live their lives. The result is a swing to cruel excess in response. \\n For all its faults, I am glad I live on this side of the Atlantic ... and these comics help to tell me why ...\"),\n",

Not that there's anything wrong with those things, they've just never described me. \\n Let's get this said right away - Absolutely everybody should read this book! \\n Tomboy is a graphic memoir by Liz Prince that focusses on her childhood, friendships, gender norms and the pressures of fitting in (or not fitting in) with social norms. Recently my 14yr old guide-daughter has been telling people she is a tomboy. This hasn't come as any surprise to me - she has always been a tomboy, to the point that I have never really questioned it or given it much thought. Unfortunately, some family members have not been very supportive of this and have told her that whether she likes it or not, she is a girl and it's tough shit if she doesn't feel like it. I want to support her to explore her gender and become comfortable with who she is rather than feeling like she needs to conform to norms and expectations. So why are you rambling about this right now CJ?! Well, this is what prompted me to try and find books that dealt with being a tomboy, so I can become more educated, and so I can teach her that just because she doesn't fit in a binary gender box, she is still marvellous, talented, funny, and smart and is worth no less than any other person. \\n How can I ignore the fact that I'm so different if no one else can? \\n There are moments of laugh out loud hilarity and moments of heartbreaking sadness throughout this. Throughout the early part Liz always wears a hat. The hat becomes part of her character and who she is. In one scene the hat is thrown away by some bullies and whilst Liz is desperately searching for it she is telling herself Don't cry. Don't cry. Don't cry. She doesn't find the hat. This moment broke my heart and I may have cried a lot felt a little bit sad. It is funny, honest, and highly informative without preaching or hating on other people's ignorance. I believe the best way to change social expectations is to show love, kindness, and compassion. It is better to educate people and encourage them to be the best they can be than create a barrier by belittling them and showing them hatred. This book manages to educate without hating on everyone else. I read this in one night and loved every moment of it. \\n Also, 'Why don't you go fuck a tree?!' may be entering my bank of daily phrases.\"),\n",

       "  'This particular arc of Avengers Academy is not my favourite of the series, and the title itself is far from my favourite comic book(I am reading it now mostly out of curiousity about the kids in Avengers Arena), but there is something about this story that appeals to me, and the form it takes exemplifies one of the things I love most about comics. \\n Let\\'s talk about the latter first. This is anecdotal, so bear with me if it doesn\\'t apply to you, but many people I\\'ve spoken to about comics see them as a genre within other media. For instance, you find comic books in the Barnes & Noble or the Chapters-Indigo over by the Sci-Fi & Fantasy books, implying they\\'re a subgenre of a genre of \"book,\" or you find them in a convenience store in a comic rack next to the magazine rack, suggesting that they\\'re \"magazines for kids.\" There are other folk who see them as a sort of blueprint for film that has just happened to make it into cheap little, pulpy mags for kiddy consumption, making them a sort of sub-medium of \"film.\" \\n To me, however, what makes comics so alluring, so worth my time, is that they are a medium all unto themselves. They are not books with pictures or static films with words printed on the page; they are their own entity, an entity that shares characteristics of those other forms, even bridges the gap between those forms, but they are their own artform with myriad possibilities. Every genre I can think of -- in film or literature -- is its own genre in comic books. Every single one. Which is what this arc of Avengers Academy put me in mind of, and it is precisely what I think it exemplifies: the idea that comics can be and can do anything that other media can be and can do. \\n This arc in Avengers Academy is a soap opera. Perhaps a Degrassi Avengers High or an Avengers Mansion 10022, rather than a Young and the Superpowered or Days of our Super-Lives, but it is a soap opera nonetheless. The students are bouncing up against their personal dramas while swinging back and forth between dumb decisions and heroism; there is constant discussion about everyone\\'s feelings and how those feelings are informed by all the relationships, and how those relationships inform and are shaped by other relationships. There are perceived slights, infidelities, bastard children, tortured souls, silly villains, and more hyperdrama than your average day in Genoa City, which is precisely what pleases me about this tale and returns us to the \\'former\\' place wherein I began this ramble. \\n I love soap operas. I spent a large part of my life watching them with my Mom, and even today I can join in with the two I\\'ve already mentioned plus General Hospital and I\\'ll be up to speed in fifteen minutes. Sure, I am a bigger fan of dramatic fare, or mysteries, or Sci-Fi, but when I need to kill some time and escape, when I need to check my brain at the door, when I just want a little, unadulterated silliness and fun, I will watch a soap. Avengers Academy is exactly that for me during the Will We Use This in the Real World? arc. Dumb fun. And a reminder that comics span as many genres as the otehr forms I love so much. \\n Comics, as a form, deserve more respect because comics can make the shift to screen and page as seamlessy films and books can make their way into the pages of a comic. Comics are equal to these other forms in importance (and I gauge this \"importance\" based on their ability to change people personally as well as they impact they can have on our culture/pop-culture) and artistry. Comics are awesome. Don\\'t let anyone tell you any different.'),\n",

Still, it offers a truly cosmic storyline and manages to kick off many of the characters who would later become the core of DnA\\'s vision. \\n Drax. This prologue to Annihilation is definitely a slow burn, but it\\'s a beautiful character piece with beautiful art besides [7/10]. \\n Prologue. This is very much a Prologue. It\\'s dramatic, exciting, and entirely inconclusive. The artwork is also very different from \"Drax\", but I grew fond of its Moebius-like look as I read on [6/10]. \\n Nova. This book does a good job of combining the personal with the cosmic. On the one hand, it\\'s quite funny and on the other it shows horrible galactic carnage. I also love seeing the evolution of Richard Ryder in this volume [7/10]. \\n Silver Surfer. An OK story with OK art.

There\\'s a bit too much fighting sometime, but it\\'s a cute story [6+/10]. \\n Ronan. An interesting character study of Ronan and nice artwork, but much of the story isn\\'t very connected to the Annihilation Wave, and thus feels all over the place. [6/10] \\n These various mini-series following thePrologue are definitely the weakest part of the series. For one thing, they seem unable to advance the plot. Another problem that I have with these mini-series is inconsistency. They just don\\'t feel like they meld together into a cohesive whole. Variable representations of the annihilation horde were the most obvious: Giffen depicts them as silent killers, while they\\'re absolutely chatty in some of the other mini-series. \\n Annihilation. The actual Annihilation mini-series picks up where the Prologue left off and offers up a truly cosmic story of the sort that DnA weren\\'t really able to replicate in what followed (despite all of the strengths of their own writing). Drax vs. Thanos! Galactus bound! It\\'s a really, really big show and Giffen does a great job with it. There\\'s also some strong writing in the individual issues as Giffen tells a story that has scope in both characters and time. If people say Annihilation was great, this is why [8/10]. \\n Heralds. A fair coda to the main story. \"A Death of Hope\" is a wonderful story about Stardust, and \"Brother\\'s Keeper\" addresses a big dangling thread from Annihilation..

It is so incredible that Kagan McLeod packed so much fun in a tome so thick, densely drawn with the best movement and action illustration I have seen. Infinite Kung Fu is certainly on top in the fun department. \\n McLeod doesn't also shy away from mashing-up different genres. Although Infinite Kung Fu is a straight-up martial arts comics that we have countlessly seen in 70s martial arts movies and from those Sunday afternoon Chinese Kung Fu TV, the material includes subgenres of zombie action, blaxpoitation and even a bit of steampunk (at which that wicked entrance of Charles at the climax part caught me by surprise). \\n Infinite Kung Fu is best read when you are not thinking about it and just chomping on the graceful illustrations made by the author which truly embody what a big budget Hollywood-plus-Bruce Lee-esque martial arts movie would be if it is done in the graphic novel medium. There might be a bit of backstories and re-reading to do because of the abundance of characters, but thankfully the whole reading experience is not compromised by those names. \\n Speaking of names, there's one I will not forget: Moog Joogular (play Isaac Hayes' Theme from Shaft here). He's the embodiment of funky groovy kung fu! May Buddha bless him! \\n Now as I've said before, Infinite Kung Fu is best enjoyed as a mindless action graphic novel, because it is so brilliant and deliciously good in doing that. So with that said, I am pretty much surprised with the ending, disappointed even because all of a sudden, the philosophical and spiritual aspects of the book has suddenly taken the wheel and drove the story to a sudden, anti-climatic end.

So often alternate realities are cast aside afterward and ignored, even if major things happened in that other world, but here we get something better -- major character growth, mainly for two characters who lived a lifetime together. [8/10] \\n After that, the volume moves over to two intertwined issues of Magneto and Uncanny and they\\'re a bit more \"meh\". For one thing, they\\'re really telling a Magneto story, and they\\'re certainly not telling an Uncanny Avengers story since only three of the team are involved. Beyond that, it doesn\\'t have any closure because it\\'s all a setup for Axis. So, though there\\'s nothing specifically wrong with these issues, it feels like they should have just included them in the Axis volume as \"Act 0\".

But the movie, luckily, is a masterpiece, and it is based on the full six part manga, so I have some sense of where Akira is going and what makes it worth while. \\n As a stand alone chapter, though, Akira #1 is poor. The characters are all lame in some way, one dimensional and boring: Tetsuo and Kaneda are impossible to empathize with or like, the kids being experimented on are lame, the Colonel is all yankee action movie bluster, Kei -- the hyper-capable love interest -- has become an overdone stereotype. The action is too frenetic. The pace is unrelenting in a bad way. The dialogue, in translation, is laughable. Even the future world is suffering due to the passage of time. \\n Yet there is something, one thing, that redeems Akira for me. I often talk with friends about the cinematic qualities of American and British comics and graphic novels, but those books have nothing on Akira. Akira is like the missing link between the page and screen. I don\\'t know manga, so I can\\'t speak to whether or not this is a common feature, but Katsuhiro Otomo discards all attempts at explication. There is know \"meanwhile,\" no \"Professor Xavier\\'s School for Gifted Youngsters,\" no added commentary to refresh our memories, no bits of narration to make transitions easy. Otomo is all film editor. One bit ends and the next panel takes us somewhere else. A straight cinematic cut from one piece of action to the next. \\n For me, it\\'s worth reading just for that. \\n So even though I was super disappointed with this reading experience, I will keep reading the series.

       "  \"This review will not go into the political theses that the whole series is shoving into its readers, for it may take a very, very long essay just for me to express how much Transmetropolitan reflects the political landscape, its limitations and how much more complex reality is. Transmetropolitan for the most part captures all the stench that us people would simply not smell, the ugly details in our own city and the scandals that might have transpired in our governement that we immediately forget because we are more interested in other things like, the next episode of a tv series, or cute cats, or what would our next profile picture would be like. \\n I will give a review therefore on the technical details of the comics, and how each of its details affected my appreciation towards the material. \\n First, I want to say that Warren Ellis is a brilliant writer, not just a comic book writer, but a writer writer. He can be able to sustain a reader's interest in his prose, even though there are many times that I felt that he is just saying the same things over and over. He also have these over-the-hedge array of random words, that when put together, crafts one nasty picture that only a deranged mind can concoct. He is the real Spider Jerusalem. \\n Darick Robertson's art is as equally nasty as Ellis' writing. He made Spider a dirty bastard with inexplicable charm, his filthy assistants sexy, useful and filthy, and the Smiler oozing of political deceit. His use of bright colors and a highly contrasted palette exacerbates the violence, rowdiness and ugliness of the futuristic dystopian City. What Ellis says, Robertson shows. It is a dirty, beautiful tandem. \\n The story on the other hand meanders at the middle of the series, picking up steam on the sevenrh or eight volume. I elt that Transmetropolitan could be better told in fewer issues. But this comment of course is highly subjective. I binged-read the whole series in two weeks, cramming everything into my brain a story that took the original issues years to tell. So I'm just warning you guys that Transmetropolitan is better experienced in small doses. \\n The ending is what I expected it to be, happy with a sprinkle of sadness, as how many Vertigo series of that era has ended (I'm talking about Y The Last Man, Scalped ans Preacher) - a male protagonist too tired for the action but not completely retired, content to live in some place with grass and trees. \\n Just a spoler here: I really, really wished to see Spider using his Bowel Disruptor on the president, in its highest setting, with all the details and splatters displayed in all of its brown glory, (pretty sick, eh?) but I didn't get that. How sad. \\n I cannot imagine at first that I will read a journalism-themed comic book until the end, but Transmetropolitan is just that good.

Though we scarcely know the characters, they come alive in the Unity comic, as does their strange buddy-ship. \\n In fact, the Unity issues (1-2) are the best of this initial five-issue sequence. Unity is a superb example of how a crossover can be deeply intertwined, but still allow for individual storytelling. We certainly don't get the whole story of Unity here, but the two issues of A&A are a nicely comprehensive whole (and it's overall a great crossover that fortunately was collected in Unity Saga Volume 1, et al). [8/10] \\n Beyond that we get an origin for Archer (0), which has somewhat poor writing but is an interesting story, and a running battle with the Sect (mainly in 3-4). They're revealed as an interesting foe, but the constant fighting gets a bit old, even with the strip's humor [7/10] \\n Trouble in Paradise (5-6). This two-issue story has a remarkably thin premise: Armstrong visits his wife and drags Archer along. Nonetheless, it's an entirely delightful story showing the BWS A&A at its best. It's hilarious, it shows the great dynamic between the two, and it introduces Armstrong's great wife, Andy [8/10]. \\n Fight (7). Armstrong gets into a pointless fight. Archer reads, then fights too. Barry Window-Smith does not provide artwork. As uninspiring as it sounds [5/10]. \\n The Musketeers (8+EW). This is a fun send-up of The Three Musketeers (and of Archer) that's a really pivotal cornerstone of the VH-1 universe for its introduction of the three brothers together (and especially Ivar). Gilam also gets some great characterization [7+/10]. \\n Darque (9). Original author Layton returns for one issue and gives us one of the worst buddy plots: one of them is mind-controlled and then they fight. Then he decides to end the issue with a mass-rape of the villainess as some sort of justice. Entirely disgusting [1/10]. \\n Ivar (10-11). BWS is back and it's nice to see him giving more attention to Ivar. The problems caused by the brothers are also amusingly typical. The literally deus ex machina ending is a bit subpar though [6/10]. \\n Mummy (12). The final issue of BWS' run tries to tie up some long-running plot lines about Mahmud and the missing satchel, but some of it has been so strung out that I no longer remember how we got here [6/10]. \\n Hollywood (13-15). New author Mike Baron takes over and he kind of gets the buddyness of the comic and he kind of gets the humor, but his first plot is pretty uninspiring: Hollywood folks shoot each other up and Sect members attack. Again. [5/10]. \\n Vegas (16). This fill-in by Perham is a little bit of nothing. He gets the humor better than Baron's initial issues, but beyond that it's yet more Sect assaults [5/10]. \\n Duerst (17-19). Sadly, Baron's A+A gets worse with these three issues of random rambling and chance encounters with Duerst. There's no plot, there's no tension, and there's not a lot of funny [3/10]. \\n Yule Be Sorry (20). I was pleased to see the comic back in LA, and thus offering some chance of continuity. But this is another bad story, with unlikely random street violence and a pretty dull plot [3/10]. \\n Darque (21-22). This short arc had more potential, because it made A+A relevant again by putting them in contention with one of VH-1's biggest enemies. Except that the plot comes out of nowhere, the writing is never that good, and then it all disappears with nothing done. Sigh. [4/10]. \\n Bad Karma (23-24). Back to LA adventures, and it's increasingly obvious that despite their continuity, they suck. A gangster and his son just isn't the interesting of a plotline, especially when Baron only thinks to tie it into Archer's own abusive childhood on the last page [4/10]. \\n The Root of the Problem (25+EW). This origin of the Sect is typical shallow Baron hijinks, but at least it has a historical background and feels more important than the Hollywood foolishness [5/10]. \\n The Chaos Effect (26+EW+TCE). We get just a bit of this crossover, so it doesn't entirely make sense ... but it's not really that great anyway. There's big fighting and ... who cares. This was clearly an attempt to be the new Unity, and it really isn't. Still, it's nice to see A+A get a real ending in VH-1 [4/10]. \\n Rai 0. A great story about the future of the VH-1 universe. it tells another final fate for Archer and Armstrong, which is why it's here, but otherwise it's a setup for the second arc of the Rai series [8/10]. \\n Formation of the Sect (2008 Collection). A nice story about the origins of the Sect, but a pretty shallow one [6/10]. \\n Overall, the A+A omnibus is a story of two books. The early Archer & Armstrong is pretty good, especially in its Unity days, but it begins to fizzle out pretty soon. The Mike Baron Archer & Armstrong is shockingly bad (given what a great writer he usually is), and I'm not even sure it's worth reading for the completist.\"),\n",

Still, perhaps out of nostalgia as much as anything else I picked up this book.

Needless to say, this is also the opportunity for some very funny jokes at several Joe\\'s expense. Through this lens Van Lente explores fascinating ground about reality versus perception when it comes to our government and how much time is spent worried about doing good as opposed to being SEEN as doing good. The question is complex and this author handles it with considerable subtlety. Nor does Van Lente stop there. He further manages to consider the pain of the economic downturn and the de-industrialization of large swaths of the rust belt (I won\\'t give any spoilers, but suffice to say that when GI Joe goes to confront Cobra in America\\'s Heart Land, all isn\\'t what it seems). \\n On top of that these are great characters, thoughtfully developed - both on the Joe side and on Cobras.

No we have a cast here that is thoughtfully written even while the action is non-stop. Particular stand outs here include Cover Girl and sailor hat sporting Ship Wreck. \\n In terms of the action on the page, Steve Kurth also deserves a shout out. His art is crisp and classical with sharp lines and bold colors, perfectly suited this sort of action book. No longer do we need bubble gum balloon (or a sailor hat, or a black guy with a beret) to tell one character from another.

The first book is about Kalem\\'s search for why he is called \"Anak Bathala\" (demi-god). The language in the book has a mixture of English and Filipino terms, with Baybayin and Surat Mangyan scripts written in some parts of the book. \\n A brief overview of the whole series from their Facebook page: \\n Anak Bathala is the epic adventure of Kalem that showcases rich Filipino mythology and culture. It exhibits native Filipino beliefs and folk work intertwined with values. The other books included in the series collection are: Yamal, Arau, Yesha and Anak Bathala. Each character embodies intrinsic Filipino traits like admirable virtues of courage, determination, self-discipline, prudence, camaraderie and leadership. Their stories also uncover the deceiving sphere of glorious power. The elven persona of Yesha exudes the remarkable attributes of womanhood that represents Filipino women. Anak Bathala pays homage to the golden age of comic makers with its ground of artistic and detailed illustrations. \\n The final book of Anak Bathala juxtaposes the revolving characters of books 1-4 and how they will join together to overcome the evil transgression of Haring Nannum and Bathala Karimlan in the Land of Mystical Mindoro. \\n -oOo- \\n The story is fast-paced and interesting, but the story was too short for me to truly grasp Kalem\\'s character. But from what I have read so far, he seems nice, responsible, and brave. I thought he was going to have a love interest with his childhood friend, but reading on, I was thinking that it would be slightly hard for him to have a human relationship, especially if he has to go off into a battle. \\n I\\'m the type of reader who likes learning new things, whether they be fact or fiction. At first, I did not like the scripts used because I kept having to translate them myself. I was on page nine before I discovered that there are Filipino and English translations on pages 122 to 123. Gah. Silly me! I must say, though, that the scripts are easy to understand after a couple of pages of going back and forth. If you\\'re fluent in Filipino, I suggest you enjoy the scripts and translate them yourself. I think it\\'s part of the whole enjoying-the-graphic-novel process. \\n My primary beef with the graphic novel is that it is too dark to see the illustrations. I\\'m sure the illustrations are very nice, but too often, I had to strain my eyes to see the outlines. It made it hard for me to read and appreciate the graphic novel as a whole. The cover is nice, though. While the background is very dark, Kalem stands out, which I think is the whole point as he is the focus of book 1. \\n One thing that I did notice though is that Kalem seemed to grow older as the story progressed. I actually liked it, because I felt like the strain of the battle, the pain of losing Ba\\' was showing on his face. I felt the weight of their expectations upon him, and it was nice that these were reflected on his face. I don\\'t know if that was the intent of the creators, but it sure was a nice touch. \\n One part that confused me is the presence of the woman at the start of the novel. Though by the end of the book I pretty much knew, but it still would have been nice to know her, because I was confused as to why there is a woman there, amidst death and war. Also, by the end of the book, I wondered what happened to the mutia that Ba\\' Magiting got. Remember that? I don\\'t think it was mentioned in the story that Kalem has it, or what it is for. \\n Other things I noticed is that there are some errors such as in the line \"The panganay left Kalualhatian\". I think it lacks the word \"for\" in between left and Kalualhatian, because the idea is that he joined Bathala in Kalualhatian, leaving this world behind. Another is that there was a misplaced apostrophe in \"Detinos\\' reached further...\" \\n I\\'m hoping the next books would have more dialogue and explanations, as well as clearer images. There\\'s an excerpt of Kalem in their website and the graphics are gorgeous! I hope they\\'ll publish that edition. I\\'m not sure if it was just with my copy, but mine already had a few loose pages. I\\'m hoping that\\'s just in my case! \\n Am I going to get the next book? Probably! Because my attention was already grabbed by Anak Bathala: Kalem and I started to get curious as to what happens, and how he came to be on earth. Being a demi god, isn\\'t he supposed to be uh...somewhere else? So I\\'m really curious as to how his journey as and what his role is in the big picture. \\n If you\\'re a fan of mythology, Filipino fiction, looking for something new, a little bit of history mixed with fantasy, do be sure to check this out.

This arc imnortalizes Snyder as one of the best Batman writers. \\n There are so many elements in Endgame that I don't really know where to start. Well, it is a Batman vs Joker story but it is way more than that. This is a legendary story, a modern myth and as they put it, an epic drama of comedy and tragedy. Endgame is a masterpiece. \\n I won't spoil anything on who won but to tell you frankly, I also felt uncertain that Bats would be able to pull it through. The stakes are real. Batman for the first time is at a loss and doesn't have a concrete plan while Joker has gone serious about killing him. \\n As you progress towards the over-the-top brutal climax, Endgame lets you experience things that lays the foundation of Batman: who wins between Batman and Superman? Does he has a chance against the Justice League? What really is the Batman-Joker relationship? The League is there, the Batman family and rogues gallery are there, the whole Gotham is involved, the Snyder created Court of Owls were also present. Endgame also leaves you with more questions and lingering thoughts. Snyder has left details which are open for interpretation. \\n Endgame is the ultimate Batman fan service comic. One has to be emotionally invested to maximize the reading experience - meaning you have to start reading from the Court of Owls arc to the Death of the Family then Zero Year. Endgame is there in top tier of Bat-stories, together with The Dark Knight Returns, Year One and The Killing Joke. That's how good it is.\"),\n",

       "  'The written content is exactly what it says in the Bible (different translation is all). I will avoid referencing that in this review as we all have our own bias when it comes to that material. \\n Instead, it is better to discuss the adaptation that R. Crumb did, and how he managed to build drawings for all sorts of sections that are not easily rendered into images. Scenes like the long genealogies that are so important in the Biblical culture were done with simple snapshots (a few may have pictures based in apocryphal writings). And Crumb\\'s wonderful illustrations are always tasteful and beautiful. So detailed that there was many times I had to set it aside for a day or two, my head barely registering all the images contained on a single page. The rendering of the Garden of Eden is beautiful, the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah is also breathtaking. The faces are all incredibly rendered and the expressions on them are ever important (look at the story of Abraham and Isaac for a great example). \\n My only qualm with the entire adaptation is the drawing of God in so many of the stories. A thorough reading of the Bible leads one to believe that there were only three people who saw any part of God (in the Old Testament) and those were Adam and Eve (for they walked with God) and Moses (who only saw his hand and his back end once). In fact, one of the main reasons for the commandment prohibiting idols is that God has not shown himself (physically) and thus any idol they create is a guess as to what God looks like and can never be accurate. It is true that the Bible says he made man in his own image, and that is why I can understand drawing a male figure for those sections in Eden, but to include the same drawing beyond that scene is not accurate. \\n That aside, though, this is an amazing book and anyone serious about studying Genesis NEEDS to read this book. The notes at the end are also very enlightening and further demonstrate the level of thought that went into creating this opus. R. Crumb did a wonderful job with this illustrating the humanity of all the personages in a reverent way that should not offend anyone (yes, even those pictures demonstrating HOW people were \"begot\"). \\n I can\\'t recommend this enough: as a study guide, as a work of art, as an entertaining adaptation of a classic work, or as however you want to view it. This is a strong work and I wish that R. Crumb would go beyond Genesis, but I completely understand if he didn\\'t.'),\n",

       "  'From Hell has quite a reputation to live up to. I must have set my sites too high though, because I was a bit disappointed in the \"greatest comic ever written.\" It might have been the greatest once upon a time (first published in 1989 in serial format), but having read it in 2015, I think it lost some of it\\'s original grandeur. I think this is partially because it was one of the first widely published serious, adult, and fairly literary works in the comic genre. I may be wrong on that, I\\'m just speculating as I don\\'t really know the history. \\n As for my reading experience, I thought it was decent, but far from the best I\\'ve read. There was definitely some depth here, but also some seemingly pointless pieces. I started to read the appendix/explanation but I found it rather dry and wanted to judge the comic on it\\'s surface instead. The story itself was interesting and I liked how it was from all these different perspectives. Whether the theory has any ground, I\\'ll leave to others to decide, but Alan Moore definitely did some homework to come to this story. The depiction of the final murder was nightmare inducing, even despite the artwork. \\n For the artwork, I really didn\\'t care for it. While some panels I thought were really really great, for the most part the entire thing seemed like the sketch that the final drawings would be based on, not a final version itself. I did, however, like when the art style changed occasionally between characters. I think more of that could have been employed. But for the most part, it was either difficult to tell what was going on, (which is probably for the best in certain brutal scenes), or more importantly who the character in a scene was. Some of it looked like it was a page that had been photocopied about 100 times and that was the final rendering that was published. Just all in all, extremely disappointed in the artwork. \\n The lettering was absolutely abysmal, in my opinion. I read this on a 7\" kindle, and zoomed so that only the three panel horizontal section showed at a time. I still have difficulty reading it. Sometimes it was fairly clear, though never great. Other times, it was downright messy and blurred, and I don\\'t think it was a style choice, because it wasn\\'t consistent. \\n Would I recommend it? Yes, once.

       "  \"Len Wein is back to write a new Swamp Thing story, and Kelley Jones is around to offer artwork that's appropriately horrific. So, we might be expecting some good old-fashioned horror. And that's pretty much what we get in the first two issues, which are a zombie fight that could have appeared in v1 of Swamp Thing. \\n Unfortunately, the first problems with Wein's writing also appear in those first two issues. It's pretty obvious that he's either not familiar with or doesn't care about the decades of evolution this character has enjoyed since he wrote him. Oh, there are sops to Swampy's long continuity, suggesting he's still the avatar of the Green, just not returning their calls. But Swamp Thing's powers and psyche are just far enough off, that he doesn't feel right. \\n Then we get the final four issue arc which is just horrible. It starts off with Matt Cable wandering in as if he hadn't been killed, turned into a raven, and then killed again. Then we get some pretty horrible character assassination of Cable, one of the most interesting characters in Swamp Thing lore. \\n Along the way Swampy loses his powers, which happened in Swamp Thing v1 and even happened at the very end of Swamp Thing v2 via an extremely similar mechanism: wishing matches (versus a wishing hand here). So, no points for originality. \\n How do you complete the ruination of this comic? Bury it with a who's who of mystical heroes wandering in for whatever reason. And don't make them interesting or evocative at all. Then add in Arcane, because how can you have a Swamp Thing comic without Arcane. But don't include any of the nuance of the Arcane and the Rot from v5. \\n In the end, you just have to pray that this volume is forgotten, considered out of continuity, or something, because it's disrespects every single volume of Swamp Thing from Moore through Snyder, and probably a few others as well. If this has been a historic comic, set amidst v1 or early v2 of Swamp Thing, it could have been good, but allowing Wein to write a post-v5 Swamp Thing, when he clearly doesn't care about the last 30 years of development was ... disastrous.\"),\n",

       "  'I was largely enthralled with X-O Manowar when it was first released. The idea of combining Conan and Iron Man was terrific, and Aric was a wonderful character. As with all of the original Valiant books, I don\\'t think that X-O Manowar entirely holds up to the modern expectations of comic writing, and it gets wobbly when the author changes halfway through the volume, but it\\'s still an interesting story with strong characters, and there are several nice heights throughout. \\n Birth (0-6). \"Retribution\" (1-2) is a great arc because it shows Aric at his best, as a barbarian outsider. And I\\'m astounded that we really knew nothing about his past until the zero (0) issue, which feels like a vital part of his chronology nowadays (and such beautiful art, and I loved the original chrome cover!). The Harbinger crossover (3-4) is fun because it puts Aric firmly in the VH1 Valiant universe, but beyond that it\\'s more cliched and standard, so not nearly as good as its predecessor. Fortunately the Ax issues (5-6) are a return to form, and another very nice connection to the VH1 universe [7+/10]. \\n Unity (7-8+9). Great crossover issues (7-8) that show Aric at his barbarian best and almost make sense even without the rest of the Unity Saga. The climax is rather shocking, though sadly the repercussions aren\\'t what you\\'d expect. The \"Homecoming\" issue (9) is then a great coda to Aric\\'s voyage through time that really underlines how he\\'s a man without a home [7+/10]. \\n Seed of Destruction (10-13). There\\'s a lot to love in Arik\\'s second Homecoming (10), particularly for the light it sheds on Ken\\'s character. The subsequent story (11-13) with the origin of the X-O is also quite beautiful, then Arik goes back into full barbarian mode and things become scary. Unfortunately things peter out in the last issue, first because Valiant sadly can\\'t include the Solar crossover (though kudos to them for summarizing it), then because the last issue is largely a pointless fight. Still, this is an intriguing arc that increases the scope of the X-O story [7/10]. \\n Turok (14-15). A nice way to bring Turok to the modern-day, through Aric. In theory, this is a nice team, but to a certain extent they\\'re too similar to really be exciting together [6+/10]. \\n Guns & Mobsters (16-17). New author Jorge Gonzalez comes aboard, and his first two issues just aren\\'t the most exciting. He plays up the barbarian angle too much, and his threats are too mundane. The result is the worst of X-O to date, sadly [5/10]. \\n Operation Deep Freeze (18-20). Fortunately, in going to a bigger story, Gonzalez strikes upon a more interesting plot, taking X-O out of its months of doldrums. The fight with the American government is a good one, though it seems dealt with a little simply at the end. Bringing up Randy as another supporting cast member is also well done. My only issue is that Aric doesn\\'t seem quite barbaric enough. I have big troubles with how he dealt with the hostage situation at the end of #18, for example. Still, this is a good read [6+/10]. \\n X-O Woman (21-24). The passing of the ring is really well done and creates a great new dynamic. I also feel like it really let Gonzalez define his own era of X-O, rather than causing continuous comparisons with the former Aric eras. However, Ax is way overdone by now as a recurring villain [7/10]. White Kings (22-24). This is a nicely-paired diptych with Randy in the armor and Aric featuring setbacks of his own. It\\'s the sort of personal character piece that was too often missing from comics of past generations [7/10]. \\n Armorines (A0 + 25). Sadly, the intro of the Armorines is subsumed by an artificial let\\'s-fight set up by some guy and a scorned IRS agent. The main Armorine seems interesting enough, but the identical suits are dull and none of the rest of the cast really rises up to notice [5/10]. \\n The Gift (26). A great story about Ken\\'s character and Aric\\'s honor; a very nice done-in-one that also ties back to older continuity [7+/10]. \\n The Spiders (27-30). Gonzales definitely seems to have come into his own with this final arc. The return of the spiders is a nice plot, but it\\'s really the death and rebirth of the X-O armor that knocks this story out of the park. As always with these X-O stories from the \\'90s, the pacing seems off, with things sliding by way too fast, but this is nonetheless one of the stronger stories in the omnibus [7+/10].'),\n",

I\\'m thankful for a horrible movie and a whitewashed TV show finally getting the old Hellblazer collections on track. \\n In Another Part of Hell (84). Delano\\'s back, and this is a terrific story. It\\'s a powerful one-off, and it\\'s also great for the light it sheds on the Chas/John relationship. [8/10] \\n Warped Notions (85-88). I\\'ve never been able to connect well with Eddie Campbell\\'s writing, and this is no exception. It may be that he\\'s too subtle, it may be that this is such an abrupt departure from Ennis\\' run, and it may be that the end of the story is rather sudden. There are some fascinating bits though, like the ghosts and the idea of urban legends come to life (although that\\'s never used to its best potential and it feels a bit redundant with \"Larger than Life\" back in #23). So ultimately, this is an interesting arc, with some flaws. [6+/10]. \\n And after that I\\'m happy to see our new regular writer actually come aboard. \\n Dreamtime (89-90). I have to commend Paul Jenkins for continuing right on with where Eddie Campbell had left the story. Too many Hellblazer authors have moved on to their own supporting cast and their own antagonists; Jenkins may be the only one who gave a lot of attention to what came before him. With that said, this was another story that I wasn\\'t thrilled with, and together with Campbell\\'s story it was enough to make me give up Hellblazer these many years ago, when they were originally published. It\\'s slow and it\\'s so far outside of Constantine\\'s normal comfort zone that it felt like a bad intro for a new writer. Still, the focus on an earth goddess is intriguing, as I know Jenkins returns to the topic in his later work [6/10]. \\n Riding the Green Lines (91). This story is all over the place and has too much verbiage, but the core image of a phantom bicyclist floating through the night is haunting [7/10]. \\n Critical Mass. (92-96). I\\'ve long been sad that Jenkins\\' Constantine was out-of-print, and this is a large part of the reason why. This story is a magnificently iconic story about Constantine. He\\'s the trickster personified, the man who knows all the angles, and the screw-up all at the same time. This story does a great job of bringing in both Delano\\'s stories about Astra and Ennis\\' stories about the First of the Fallen, and manages to book-end everything from \"Newcastle\" to \"Dangerous Habits\". At the same time, Jenkins expands upon his new supporting cast, begins to lay the foundation for his vision of a more English Constantine, and introduces a major plot element that has repercussions down the road. Without this being in print, Hellblazer was missing one of its major lynch-pins ... and a terrific one [9/10]. \\n This book as a whole is a bit hit or miss, mostly because of the mediocre material from 85-90, but once Jenkins really gets to tell his own stories, it takes off.'),\n",

If you\\'re a fan of magical girls like Sailor Moon, you should definitely check Zodiac Starforce. Let me start off with character designs, I love it. I love the \"big\" hair too. Reminds me of Jem & The Holograms, the animated series and not the movie. \\n There are flaws to this first volume. The story starts with absolutely no explanation about our four protagonists. Nada. The beginning was a bit confusing because it doesn\\'t properly introduce the characters. I had to read the beginning twice just to make sure I didn\\'t miss anything. I would have liked for each of the girls to have their backstory revealed and how they got chosen by Astra, a celestial goddess. It feels as if I picked up a second book in a series, instead of the first book. Hopefully each girl has their backstory explained in upcoming volumes because it\\'s a issue that needs to get resolved. \\n As for the pacing of the story, it was a bit rushed. I would have liked for more details, but alas, that was not the case. I am hoping that the next volume does not encounter the same issues I found with Zodiac Starforce. As for the characters, my favorite had to be Kim aka Aries. She has most of the funny moments in the overall story. I am hoping that she gets much more screen time. The bond between the girls was not strong enough for me. Why? Even though the girls have gone through many perils, it is said but not seen. Lack of an introduction to each other the characters makes this story a bit weak for me. \\n Final thoughts? Zodiac Starforce is a entertaining graphic novel. Even though I had issues with it, I still want to continue the story. Here are my reasons why you should read Zodiac Starforce? \\n Diversity: All the girls are diverse and so are the background characters. It is quite refreshing.

This is sexuality that is true to the teenage spirit, at least the spirit I remember, and yet it all manages to remain cute and sweet. \\n Put all together in its cute package, My Dead Girlfriend is an excellent little comic book (they call it Manga on the cover, and maybe it is.

This story ended up focusing more on Ballister Blackheart, which in and of itself was my preference. I enjoy him as a character the most. But that also left Nimona to feel very one note. Also, I found the plot to be fairly predictable in a lot of ways. \\n Lastly, I found myself annoyed with how Blackheart and Goldenloin weren\\'t depicted in a way that blatantly showed they were gay. While, yes, it is obvious to most people, I have seen plenty of people say they are just \"best friends.\" Fans of the webcomic may not have picked up on this, as I know that Noelle has since come out and said she is regretful for not making it blatant and does frequently show fanart or even her own art of them looking couple-y on her blog. Their romance (and friendship) was the heart of the story, and I felt it didn\\'t quite achieve what it could because it held back. \\n Overall, I found Nimona to be a cute story, but it did not live up to the overwhelming amount of hype and I\\'ve found it to be forgettable since I\\'ve read it.

He has made it his mission to find and kill Sweet, along with some other vampires along the way. \\n \"The Nocturnes\" rounds out the story in this volume. Calvin Poole, who we met during the World War II arc, is in Alabama in 1954. He runs into a group of veterans, the Fighting Canines, who turn out to be a variant species of werewolf. Calvin takes it upon himself to rid the town of the werewolves who are holding the town hostage. \\n Overall, I enjoyed the stories collected in the volume. Scott Snyder continues to put together great stories and gives us more of a history to the world he has created. Rafael Albuquerque\\'s art continues to be incredible, and was definitely my favorite of the artist featured in this volume. \\n Moving on to volume 5...'),\n",

       "  'The Good --It\\'s compelling: Despite Message to Adolf\\'s flaws, it is a story that builds inertia in the reader. Once I started reading, I slowly picked up speed until I finally raced to the end at breakneck pace, even losing some sleep to get to the end of this first part. \\n The chapter structure, heavily reliant on cliff-hangers, makes it very hard to put down, especially when Sohei Toge is unconscious again from his umpteenth injury, but I think the primary agent of Message to Adolf\\'s readability is that it\\'s Manga. The comic book format makes the action much more compelling than I think it would be in prose. The action is, I suppose necessarily, comic booky, which suits this medium, but wouldn\\'t work at all in a novel. It makes it fun rather than tedious, and with such serious issues as anti-Semitism, facism, and misogyny as its themes, some \"fun\" action bits are required to \"lighten\" the mood. \\n The Axis Perspective: Probably my favourite part of this read is that it gives us a rare glimpse into the Axis perspective -- albeit a flawed and self-serving one (more on this later). The only location we see beyond Germany and Japan is Lithuania, and that only for the briefest of moments. Moreover, only one time do we see any of the \"Allies,\" one French and one American intelligence agent. That\\'s it. The rest of the books is comprised of Germans, Japanese, Japanese-Germans, and German-Jews, and they all move through their respective Axis nations. While this isn\\'t totally unique (I have certainly read a few), there aren\\'t enough books that adopt this setting and point of view, so I am always on the lookout for more books that do this. Please point me in the right direction if you have a suggestion, fair reader. \\n The Bad --The Manga-y Manga: There are times that come too often for my taste when the Manga cheesiness overcooks. Times when the giant mouths, moon eyes and fluid skeleture undermine the seriousness of the subject matter. Perhaps it makes such things more palatable and allows for Tezuka to deal with his subject -- especially in a Japan of the 80s -- with more openness than he could otherwise, but thirty years after creation, this cheesiness is disruptive, feeling far too foolish for what is on display. \\n Argumentum ad Hominem: Tezuko never engages in an actual criticism of Nazi policy, but he is clear throughout that the Nazis are the enemy. Every Nazi, but our one Japanese-German boy and a Nazi fraulein driven to \"badness\" by her Gestapo father, is a hamfisted caricature of evil. They are universally \"evil,\" universally without nuance, and universally unbelievable, and they do nothing to show us how and why the Nazis are wrong. In fact, the very existence of the Nazis in this story feels like apologetics, a way to prove that Japan wasn\\'t bad because \"Japan weren\\'t the Nazis\" -- almost as though the Japanese were victims of Axis necessity rather than active agents in their WW2 fate. That they made a deal with the devil, and the devil himself is responsible for that deal. This story could have been vastly more effective if the Japanese and Germans had been more realistic, especially if a genuine argument had been made.The Questionable --The Core is Unconvincing: The core of this story is the idea that \"evidence\" has been uncovered that Hitler has a Jewish grandfather, making him one quarter Jew, and that this information is the single most important evidence of the war years -- that it alone could topple the Nazi government. It\\'s pretty to think so in our temporal distance from Nazi Germany, but even the teensiest knowledge of Goebbels propaganda machine, the Nazi talent for trumping up conspiracy and their ability to manufacture opinion tells us this is false. Now I can still cut the story slack on this because I do think that German Intelligence would seek to destroy the evidence, and I can see how some in the war, particularly the Jewish dissidents would see this as a possible opportunity, but I can not cut the same slack to serious journalists, such as Sohei Toge, and serious communist opponents of Nazism, such as Toge\\'s brother and Miss Ogi, who must surely have had less emotional bias and more room for logical thought -- but then maybe I give humanity too much credit. Suffice to say, then, for me this didn\\'t work. \\n I will definitely be reading the second part of Message to Adolf, but I must first sign off with a one word summation of the piece at half time: eccentric.'),\n",

       "  \"I could be out of touch here, and maybe I am, but I am having serious problems with this critically acclaimed iteration of Jem and the Holograms when it comes to believing in the ages / maturity of Jerrica and her sisters. \\n I have an eight year old daughter, a thirteen year old daughter, and I spend much of my time around 18-20-something women, and there are times in Jem and the Holograms when any of the characters could be any of those ages. The most consistently mature is Jerrica, but even she slips into bizarrely childlike behaviour from time to time. \\n The ages / maturity just don't ring true to me. Even Scoutie, my eight year old, is more mature than some of the characters some of the time, and all the other women I am around on a regular basis make Jerrica and her sisters seem inconsistently written at best or utterly vapid at worst. And this is a huge shame because it distracts from many of the things for which Kelly Thompson deserves praise. The focus on young women doing it on their own (-ish), the fact that a compelling story is being told almost without violence, creativity and the arts as a pursuit being praised rather than denigrated, male characters in supporting roles (yet remaining interesting and worthwhile), themes of love and trust and self-respect and body positivity all getting some time on stage -- these are stories worth telling and they are mostly being told well -- except for the odd immaturity that seems to take hold of the characters from time to time. \\n The age vs. maturity issue really does hinder my enjoyment. Most of the time I think it is the inconsistent art that is to blame (too many different artists disrupt the story's flow), but sometimes it is in Thompson's writing too. Jem and the Holograms and their enemies, the Misfits, can go from reasonably bothered to spoiled bratty in the space of a panel, and it undermines my desire to pull for them. But you know what ... I know this comic isn't for me. I know I'm not the target audience, and my littlest girl loves it, so who am I to be mean about Jem and the Holograms? I am the wrong person to be judging. But as long as Scoutie is reading these, I will be too, and I fear my struggle with the maturity of the bands will continue. \\n Oh well, It's definitely worth a read or two, especially if you are an eight year old who loves to play piano and loves to cosplay Jem.\"),\n",

       "  'My introduction to the X-Men, many years ago, was the Dark Phoenix Saga (even though it was already a couple of years old when I found it). Up until then I\\'d been consuming Namor and the staples: Batman, Superman, Captain America, Spiderman. My starting place was not a bad place to start; it was, in fact, a pretty fine place to start. Maybe too fine. Starting with one of the finest chapters of the X-Men might be why I\\'ve mostly been a passing fan of Marvel\\'s mutants over the years. Nothing could quite live up to the excellence of the Chris Claremont & John Byrne partnership. \\n I\\'d pop into the X-Men for a visit if I heard an arc was worth reading or if a crossover made a visit essential, or even buy a mini-series with an X-Man I liked, but I was never an avid reader. \\n I had no idea until recently that my introduction to the X-Men was as significant to my personal mythology as it was and is, but somewhere in my squishy brain bits that first moment with the X-Men planted some seeds that germinated into my contribution to our youngest daughter\\'s name. \\n When I chose the name nine years ago (a name which was supposed to be my son Milos\\' when he and his twin sister Bronte were born, but he was a boy, \"Damn it!\" and he screwed up my plans), everyone wondered why I would chose a name like the one I chose, especially when I instantly replaced it with a nickname. I couldn\\'t provide an answer beyond, \"I dunno. I\\'ve always just loved those names.\" The name and the nickname felt right. \\n It took Joss Whedon\\'s* Astonishing X-Men Vol. 1 Gifted to answer that question and reveal the roots of the brain shrub that had been growing since I was a kid, but the answer was there in the pages of his epic X-Collaboration with John Cassaday. \\n As soon as I started reading I was greeted by an old, old friend -- Shadowcat. She\\'s late for her return to Professor Xavier\\'s School for Gifted Youngsters, and she finds an empty school upon her arrival, so she starts walking through walls and sinking through floors trying to figure out where everyone\\'s gone (she can phase through anything, in case you didn\\'t know). And I am thrilled. I instantly remember how much I\\'ve loved Shadowcat through the years, and I hope that she\\'ll bump into Wolverine soon (in the movies, Rogue\\'s relationship with Wolvie is based on the comic book relationship between him and Shadowcat). Instead, she stumbles into a school assembly and shrugs off the embarrassment at her lateness when the new Headmistress, Emma Frost (former White Queen of the Hellfire Club), mocks her. She gives Emma a sassy tongue lashing and reminds the White Queen that the first time they met Emma tried to kill her, derailing her search for the X-Men and unleashing a Dark Phoenix. I snort at Shadowcat\\'s telling blow, then remember that Dark Phoenix was indeed the first appearance of Kitty Pryde. \\n And I start to wonder without any serious thought whether \"Kitty\" has anything to do with my Kitty Kat\\'s nickname; something is shaking those roots, but I ignore it and keep reading until it comes clear. \\n You see ... another old favourite appears right near the end Colossus, resurrected from the dead by alien baddy, Ord , and he calls Kitty by the name only he calls her -- \"Katya\" -- and I know the source of my contribution to Scoutie\\'s name: Katya Gwendolyn Scout. I should have known all along, but somehow the source slipped away from me only to be revealed in the best X-Man comic since the Dark Phoenix Saga. \\n I think they\\'re fabulous. Both the comic and the revelation it catalyzed. And I love comics. And Joss Whedon. And most of all I love my Scoutie Kat. \\n *For all you oldsters out there: did you know that Joss Whedon\\'s Dad, Tom Whedon, was the head writer for The Electric Company?

Despite those origins, he's been used well in the VH-E universe, and Kindt continues to rehabilitate him here by turning him into an anti-Batman. His parents are still alive, but uncaring, while the butler who raises him is abusive. \\n Weaponeer (1-5). The main story of Weaponeer is quite well done: an exciting bit of spy craft that is follows the tropes of Jack Vance's Demon Princes, as Ninjak prepares to find and kill seven demonic arms dealers. However, it really excels in its multiple levels of stories, as we're simultaneously learning about Colin's youth, his early days with MI6, and even the history of his foes. It's more depth than you ever see in a comic, and what raises this from good to great. \\n The Shadow Wars (6-9). Ninjak hunts the remaining four members of the Shadow Seven (though I must have missed something, because I only count six!). This volume continues to be exciting and it continues to have great backstory on Colin, including a few different surprises. The villain-of-the-month formula is a little stagnant, but despite that, this continues to be an enjoyable book. \\n Operation Deadside (10-13). My problem with this third volume of Ninjak is that it's a muddle. That's in large part due to the immersion into the Shadowman mythos. Mind you, Kindt actually seems to do well with Deadside, given it some character that was missing from the similar dimensional travels of The Death-Defying Doctor Mirage: Deluxe Edition, but it's not enough when you really can't figure out what's going on with the Magpie, who seems to be Shadowman gone evil. \\n Maybe this would be cleared up if Valiant ever published Shadowman: Deluxe Edition, Book 2, which has been getting pushed back on their schedule for years, but without that, I just don't know what was going on here (and the story also loses a lot of its emotional resonance). \\n The biggest problem with this volume is that it's in a continual slide downward.

And while a story with a fair number of flaws -- if possible I\\'d give it 2.5 stars -- there is enough that works to make this book an entertaining read. \\n First a bit about my view on these sorts of giant cross title events. Often the best book in such enterprises are those side stories spawned by the main action (think Robinson\\'s fabulous Starman #81 which was my favorite part of the much-hyped Blackest Night). Justice League of America: Survivors of Evil is such a side story. It doesn\\'t have much to do with the main action of Forever Evil which deals with the Lex Luthor gathering a group of criminals to fight the Crime Syndicate. Instead, this book answers the question of where (and how!), the CS imprisoned the JLA (and if, like Dr. Evil\\'s son Scott, you are wondering why they didn\\'t just shoot them in the head, the explanation is actually pretty good). It may not be the best of Forever Evil, but it makes fro an interesting bit character exploration. \\n Breaking the JLA out turns out to be something of a problem and solving that problem is left to Stargirl. Kindt takes this character, in whom you might not have otherwise had much interest, and does a great job developing her across this story. We get her inner life. We come to understand her fears. And we see the choices she must make that can break a young costumed hero. If like me you are a huge Jack Knight fan, you may (SLIGHT SPOILER) be disappointed that the new 52 seems to write Jack out of Courtney\\'s back story. But it still makes for a good read. \\n For all that, the story does suffer from some serious flaws. As much fun as it is looking inside the heads of members of the JLA, seeing their forbidden dreams, the story still sags in the middle. Kindt is writing a \"mystery,\" but at times it feels like he is just playing for time rather than moving along the story.

The manga is still ongoing, well the translation that is, so I will make a second review when it finishes, though I am not sure about it, because I believe I will just make a small announcement that it has already ended. But well, if you want to start reading this interesting story, don\\'t wait for it to end, there are already many developments, and well volume 5 ended with a premonition for something new and troublesome to start. \\n Okay, now a small straying off the topic, but it\\'s not really that. It\\'s some useful information too. First of all, let me ask you a question! Are you new to manga or anime world? If yes, you\\'ll have some troubles with getting some characters, but don\\'t worry you\\'ll get him nevertheless. If you are an old fan, no problems for you, you\\'ll understand both Hikari and Iroha. Now, let me explain some stuff and you\\'ll move on. For us (anime and manga lovers) there are at least 2 words: 3D and 2D or in plain English real world and online world. If you know what I mean, then you already understand Hikari\\'s troubles. Meaning, he was a \"normal\" high school student, who enjoyed playing games and watching anime with his only friend until a day when he meets Iroha and all the troubles with real world start. They start to date, but Hikari or as Iroha calls him Tsuntsun doesn\\'t get girls, especially 3D girls. Will their relationship hold? \\n Though there is another catch, even if Iroha looks like an experienced girl, she\\'s as new to relationships as Tsuntsun is. And she put a time limit to their relationship half a year. She said that it was because of her dad being relocated, but I am not buying it. I really do believe there\\'s something wrong with her health. And if you pay attention to the first chapters, you might have the same thoughts as I do. Both Iroha and Tsuntsun are amazing characters. The story is mostly from Tsuntsun\\'s POV, ad there are many moments that cracked me up, especially how he googled jealousy and then still didn\\'t get what was wrong with Iroha. He\\'s a male character that you do not really see in a shoujo manga; wait is this manga really a shoujo one? Oh, it really is a shoujo. I believe the author wanted to show us another side of relationships and that we should not always discard real life like Tsuntsun did. \\n I believe you will enjoy this manga a lot. It is not the usual one and the eccentric sides are what makes it fun and interesting to read. Enjoy it to the fullest and don\\'t forget to share your thoughts below!

Whatever you want, you can get it in the Tower. Climb to the top and get your prize. \\n Why did I take up this webtoon, and even went as far as to cover it on my blog? The answer is quite easy. I started reading it back in July 2014, when my mom and I went to the mountains. Because most of our day we spent in the forest walking around I read something to read on my phone. It was that time that I found this awesome application called \"Webtoons Line\". There were some webtoons which I was reading and some which I was dying to read. One of those was \"Tower of God\". First several chapters I was like: \"Haaa???? What the hell is going on here?!\" Then I just switched on my imagination 100% on and it started making sense, though, even now I sometimes find myself asking: what is going on? The mystery of the tower is still intact and that is what makes this webtoon amazing. You just never know what will happen next, who will betray who, and who will scheme what in order to climb the tower and get the prize he/she wishes for. \\n Keep in mind that this is a Korean webtoon, meaning that it is not black & white, but in color. Also it is read from left to right. I really liked this webtoon, because it covers a broad line of human nature. It addresses nearly all of our characteristics and brings to life not only the good one but the bad ones too. This webtoon has a lot of characters and to say the truth I only remember 5-10% of them. But that is not because they are so similar no it may be quite the opposite. Every character is absolutely different. Everyone has a goal and a reason he/she is there. There are a lot of amazing characters both from the \"good\" and \"evil\" side. The sides changed so frequently, that I got confused. \\n There are a lot of characters who make you think and reflect on what you do or have done. There are some who you just despise and who you adore. There are a lot of battles and conversation about the concept of power. The battles are especially amazing and if you just use a bit of your imagination, they come to life leaving your mouth agape and craving more. All the chapters always end on a mini cliffhanger, leaving me screaming. But what I try to do is compromise with myself and not read for at least a month, which means I have 4 chapters to munch on later, if I hold on longer more chapters and so on. This way, I read continuously, well I still do complain, however, now it is at least once a month not every week. \\n I hope you get some free time and read this amazing webtoon. If you do, or if you already are, don\\'t forget to share your thoughts with me. Enjoy a thrilling ride which is \"Tower of God\". \\n XOXO \\n Katie'),\n",

Even though the crossover mandates that most of the JLD can\\'t be used, we still get Constantine, Swamp Thing, two out of three Sinners, and the (sadly very sexist -- what was Didio thinking!?) Nightmare Nurse. It\\'s a cool set of characters. \\n Unfortunately, the book has flaws. \\n To start with, I\\'ve always found DeMatteis a hard author to read. His writing is often abstract and philosophical, and though that can produce comics that are very different from the norm, it can also produce comics that feel disconnected from reality, and here he walks that line (but is fortunately brought back over by Fawkes writing parts of this crossover). \\n Moving on, the first half of the comic is The Fight Against Blight and it unfortunately is quite tiresome at times. It goes on way too long, and they defeat the Blight no less than twice and then are unable to finish him off both times, which reminds you of how tiresome everything is. There are some great moments amidst these issues, like the trip to the edge of Paradise, but whenever we move into direct confrontation, the quality of the comic drops [5+/10]. \\n The Nanda Parbat story has some more interesting bits, but it also has some of the same flaws, such as a constant going over of the same ground: Look, everyone\\'s captured, then a few are free, then finally everyone is free. It (again) gets old. Still, the highlights of the Nick Necro triangle and the Phantom Stranger revelation are pretty good. Too bad the event then ended on a pair of deus ex machinas.

I mean, I like me some unconventional narratives, and the mixture of that and the muddy artwork isn't that different from volume 1. But, it's just not as comprehensible; I mean, I don't even know what happened with the ending! You add in more supporting cast than ever and extensive, poorly explained references to Moon Knight's past ... and it just gets to be too much! [4/10] \\n Registration (13).

The first volume of Huston was great, because it had a lot of these same characteristics, but kept things on the right line of sensibility.

I thought the synopsis was something to do with gangsters, but I wouldn't say it's that at all. It's more like patriarchies. The world has broken up into modern day city-states, or mini-kingdoms, headed by a family with serfs and peasants (of which are called waste). Each family has a Lazarus, which is a person (robot? they are created, not born) that is virtually indestructible, or rather they regenerate their bodies and are killing machines. \\n The story thus far is kind of a fight between two families, though not a whole lot really happens. The main character, Forever Carlysle, the Carlysle family Lazraus is pretty well ignorant of any goings on and isn't very independent, as far as characters go. The brother is a traitor to the family, but eventually gets found out. The sister is likely a traitor, though it's unclear her intentions. I think the story could eventually become pretty interesting, but there just wasn't enough to go on, yet. \\n The art was ok, but not amazing by any means.

       "  'Since joining goodreads, I\\'ve been baffled by the Neil Gaiman love fest. American Gods, Neverwhere, Stardust, The Graveyard Book, they appear to be universally loved, and I\\'ve been skeptical of this emotion that borders on worship. These books are good and all, and I recognize their general accessibility, but I don\\'t personally find any of them mind blowing literature. Gaiman\\'s prose is no match for China Mieville\\'s or Iain M. Banks\\' or Ursula LeGuin\\'s (and countless others who write speculative fiction), and the way he recasts mythology into contemporary settings is more clever than inspired. The love accorded Gaiman, therefore, feels disproportionate to the quality of his work - at least to me. \\n Lately, however, I\\'ve been reminded that I once loved Neil Gaiman, and that reminder was my return to The Sandman Preludes and Nocturnes. Like his other fine work, The Wolves in the Walls, The Sandman series plays to Gaiman\\'s greatest strength: his ability to conjure beautiful images from artists. But it also elevates many of the things that Gaiman is usually only able to do adequately. His writing, when confined by thought and dialogue bubbles, is inspired (mostly because its goal is to be natural and believable rather than aspiring to literary greatness); his contemporizing of mythology is much more palatable (happening, as it does, in a comic book universe predisposed to gods and heroes); and his naturally cinematic pacing works better in a graphic format. Yes, indeed...graphic novels are Neil Gaiman\\'s best form. \\n Sleep of the Just - This may be the greatest first issue of a comic ever written. The capture of Morpheus/Dream/Sandman (or whichever name of his you prefer), the sleeping sickness, his inevitable (and beautifully patient) escape and vengeance guarantees that any fan of fantasy or comic books or fantasy and comic books must continue with the series. Even better, though, Sleep of the Just could have been its own stand-alone issue, and that would have been good enough. There are few single issues of a comic that are so fulfilling. I buy it all, and everything I had to know was given to me. Luckily, Gaiman left me with plenty beyond what I wanted to know. My personal favourite: the introduction of Sandman\\'s helm. Killer. \\n Imperfect Hosts - A kick ass follow up episode that includes a taste of Sandman\\'s powers, the characters that populate his Dreamworld, and the beginning of his search for the three artefacts stolen when Burgess captured him instead of Death. This episode is most notable, however, for the way Gaiman weaves his Sandman into the existing universe of DC. I am not a DC fan. I read Batman and Superman because they are cultural requirements, and what I know of the DC Universe is filtered through the pages of those books, but Sandman was a rare piece that warped and wefted its way into the DC universe without letting itself get bogged down in DC\\'s usual shabbiness. Imperfect Hosts is where this all begins to happen. \\n Dream A Little Dream of Me - A weakened and vulnerable Morpheus is busy looking for his sandbag, the first of the three stolen artefacts that can restore him to his former splendour and power. So he tracks down John Constantine, the Hellblazer, who bought the sandbag years before and put it into storage, but the sandbag is gone, stolen by Constantine\\'s ex-lover, Rachel, a heroin addict who needed money for a fix. She never got it; instead, the sandbag took control of her mind, throwing her into a forever nightmare that included the transformation of her father into a room sized, living, breathing, tortured, mass of flesh. Dream a Little Dream of Me is a horror show that hints at the depths of nightmare Dream will combat in future issues, and it embeds Morpheus more deeply into the DC Universe. It\\'s a satisfying chapter in Morpheus\\' rebirth, and this is where the patient build towards the story\\'s literary quality begins. \\n A Hope In Hell - This is the one issue that really doesn\\'t thrill me too much. Morpheus goes to Hell and meets up with Lucifer, Beelzebub and Azazel - Hell\\'s triumvirate of Dark Lords - demanding the return of his helm. He ends up dueling Choronzon for his helm in a \"reality\" battle. Each takes a turn in the shape or form or concept of something or other. Each incarnation is slightly tougher than the opponent\\'s until the victor\\'s incarnation can\\'t be beat. Morpheus defeats Choronzon as \"hope,\" which totally sucks. Hope?! Please. I can see hope as a stage in the battle, perhaps, but as the ultimate incarnation of victory? No way. Hope can be good, but it\\'s also an emotion that can derail thought and action -- and that makes hope potentially bad and self-defeating. Still, Lucifer was cool and his parting words about Dream give us plenty to look forward to in the series to come: \"One day, my brothers...One day I shall destroy him.\" \\n Passengers - A creepy start to the search for Morpheus\\' last artefact - the Ruby of Dreams. A decrepit Doctor Destiny is sufficiently mad when he escapes Arkham Asylum, Morpheus runs into J\\'onn and Scott Free from the JLI, and the Doctor Destiny corrupted Ruby throws Morpheus into a catatonic stupor on the floor of a storage garage in the middle of nowhere, all setting the stage for the most terrifying chapter of Volume One: \\n 24 Hours - Bloody, nasty, marvelous. Dreams in the hand of a corrupted man become corruption, and the whole Earth suffers. This is the best issue of The Sandman in Preludes and Nocturnes, so I\\'ll let it speak for itself. But be warned: this one is not for the faint hearted. \\n Sound and Fury - This is a satisfying resolution to Dream\\'s return to power. Sandman shows John Dee mercy, he bestows the Earth with a night of pleasant dreams, and he returns to his Dreamscape to rebuild his kingdom. It\\'s not quite as powerful as 24 Hours, but it does what it needs to do. \\n The Sound of Her Wings - Death is a beautiful thing. If there were no other reason to love Neil Gaiman, this realization would be enough because Death really is a beautiful thing -- both in the comic and at the end of our lives \\n I\\'m glad I revisited Gaiman\\'s greatest moment. Maybe now I can enjoy his new stuff more and appreciate him as much as so many of my friends do.'),\n",

It's difficult to evaluate because the reading experience is not what I would consider pleasurable. On the other hand, this is an important addition to the world of graphic literature. I'm not sure I would call it a graphic novel; it reads more like a series of graphic novelettes, each featuring a different protagonist. But the title ties them all together with a concept that makes you think about life, its origins, and connections. And isn't that what great, everlasting literature does? So I think this will become a sustainable classic in the canon of graphic literature, in the way that Maus is. \\n Each of the 18 panels on every double-page spread features a different protagonist with his/her own life story. These people live in diverse places in different time periods. But in the end, these people are all one person, one soul, as the title conveys. I found that I had to read each story through from beginning to end, rather than read through the panels in the order that they appear on the pages. But just knowing that the panels appear the way they do on the pages suggests to readers that all these people and their lives are interconnected. \\n So the experimental format is both the book's shining glory, and its downfall. Because the fragmented nature of this layout prevents readers from really connecting with each individual protagonist on the deep level that readers expect, want, seek to do. We get the highlights of these characters' lives, not the full immersion. \\n Despite this, I am left thinking about the inter-connectedness of life, people, and time periods long after I closed the cover of this book. And I have already decided to add the book into my teaching syllabus, to expose students to the reach of graphic literature as a medium. \\n So this is not a favorite, or even a particularly enjoyable read for me.

       "  'Ghostface Killah\\'s attempt at being an author offends me to the core, but then so does any celebrity who uses their cash and influence to commit artistic masturbation and flaunt it in our faces. \\n Too many people work too hard for too long to become authors. Most toil in anonymity, some finally self-publish, a lucky few find a small publishing house where their books gain a tiny audience, and the luckiest few hit it big. Not all of these toilers are truly talented, but their work and their commitment are honest. \\n But then guys like Ghostface Killah come along. They have a name so publishers like the Hachette Book Group publish whatever drivel they spew simply because it will move copies. \\n It reminds me of Michael Jordan\\'s brief career with the Birmingham Barons. It wasn\\'t that he was terrible, but he wasn\\'t particularly good either. He hit .202 for the White Sox\\' Double-A affiliate. He had a couple of homers, a decent number of stolen bases, and some RBIs. His biggest impact, however, was in the fans Jordan brought to Regions Park. The park seats just over 10 thousand fans, and during Jordan\\'s tenure the Barons drew 985,185. But some poor right fielder, some kid who\\'d worked his whole life for the dream of playing professional baseball -- at any level -- missed a season full of games, so that rich and famous Michael Jordan could live his father\\'s dream. \\n Now I know it is unlikely that Ghostface Killah\\'s crappy graphic novel took the position of a proper graphic novelist, but the frustration is no less potent. I am a writer of graphic novels myself (amongst other things), and I can\\'t find an artist to complete my work. I don\\'t have the money to pay someone, like Mr. Wu-Tang Clan does, and finding someone to collaborate with for free is nearly impossible because they need to work paying gigs so that they can eat and live.

My stories languish. His don\\'t. \\n And let me say this quite plainly: Cell Block Z is awful. There are one or two interesting ideas, and in the hands of a talented writer/artist team those ideas could be turned into a pretty impressive ongoing series. There is enough potential material in Cell Block Z, in fact, to fill twelve 100 page graphic novels. But Ghostface Killah and his \"writing team\" were so taken with Mr. Killah\\'s narcissistic ego trip -- he is the protagonist in his own story after all -- that they ignored everything needed to make a good graphic novel: pace, characterization, plot, originality. Cell Block Z has none of these essentials (not in anything approaching significant quantity and quality). \\n Ghostface Killah\\'s love letter to himself is a string of ultra-violent cage battles, broken up by short bursts of pontification, all wrapped up in the worst kind of feel good naivete.

If you want some for your collection then take them. If you want some for yourself then take them. Just, you know, whatever.\" \\n Well, you don\\'t have to tell me twice. \\n SO, the point of this story is just a lead-in to the fact that I have read two really great books in the last week from the mysterious, neverending comics collection in the back of the Berkeley Public Library -- my own secret stash, if you will.

While it\\'s a bit trite, there is a depth here that\\'s absent in a lot of similar Batman stories, mostly because Bruce Wayne comes off as positively exhausted by the vengeful demon inside of him. \\n Even better though is \"Selina\\'s Big Score.\" It\\'s a Catwoman story done like the movie Snatch, or maybe Ocean\\'s 11. Catwoman\\'s been presumed dead for a long time, but was really just laying low and stealing shit in Istanbul or something. She comes back to Gotham to reestablish herself and make ONE BIG SCORE.

I have read these short stories when I was first introduced to the manga world and I remember I stayed all night awake as it was something that made me cry and couldn\\'t let me go. I remember that that for the last 2-3 months I had this weird feeling, I wanted to re-read this series, but I forgot the name, and because I had to look up my old notebook where I was keeping which books I read, as soon as I saw the title I knew it was it. However, let me get back to the review. As I have already mentioned the review covers 4 stories: Pao\\'s story, Ayu\\'s story, Host and Reina\\'s Fate. Each one is around 2 volumes long and can be read without reading the main series - Real. However, if you are interested in Real, there are only 23 chapters available, so if you don\\'t know Japanese, you\\'ll have to wait until someone will take it up to translate. \\n It\\'s true you can read the stories in any order, however, I believe the best order to read the is: \\n * Pao\\'s story \\n * Ayu\\'s Story \\n * Host \\n * Reina\\'s Fate \\n This way everything will fall in order and you\\'ll know the whole story. So, why should you actually read these stories? Well, the only thing I can say is realism. Yes, Yoshi as the author is outstanding at presenting the life in its real colors. So, let\\'s start our journey. \\n First is Pao, a puppy. Yes, the whole story is from the dog\\'s POV, and that makes the story even more frightening. Discover the cruelty of the human beings, but do not worry there are kind humans amongst us too. The whole story makes you wonder in which category do you actually fall into? \\n Second is Ayu, a young girl, who sells her body. You might not like Ayu as a character because she\\'s a prostitute, however, you can\\'t ignore the harsh reality that she is living in. similar to Pao\\'s story Ayu encounters both cruel and kind people. There\\'s death on her way, but the grandma and Pao are the ones who help her put away her job and live happily. But Yoshi being the realist makes Ayu start selling her body again, however, now you are encouraging her, you want it to end fast and it does. And if you have read Pao\\'s story you already know how it ends. Tragically doesn\\'t really describe it. \\n And here come\\'s in the main story Real, or if you want a short version, read the Host (The drawing is much better). It is time for Yoshioki to tell his story. Yup, he\\'s the kid with the heart decease, for whom Ayu has started working again. With his parent dead and the love of his life not near him, he applies to work in a host club. You\\'ll ask why? The answer is absolutely simple he wants to understand Ayu. Again take a journey into the \"underworld\" and try to live it without getting scarred. The story takes a quite optimistic turn at one point, however, Yoshi doesn\\'t disappoint and again the main Hero ends up all alone, twice brokenhearted, but at least he\\'s alive, but as one could say it would have been better for him to be dead. \\n And with that we are nearing the last story: Reina\\'s fate. If you have already read the previous stories you know that Reina is Ayu\\'s friend who was raped and kept the child. She named her kid Ayu and it is the time to see how her life will go on. I the beginning I though at least her story will have a happy ending, however, everything changes when Ayu becomes blind and Reina start selling her body to take care of her. No happy ending for her, she\\'s abused by her boss, her lover is killed in front of her and she goes mad. But to know more and how her story ends you\\'ll need to read the story yourself. \\n If you ask me whose story is the most tragic I would say either Yoshoiki\\'s or Reina\\'s but in the end I will still choose Yoshioki, why? If you read the story you\\'ll understand. He loses too much and he remembers everything. Are you ready for a thrilling journey into the life of teens and young adults? Enjoy it to its fullest and don\\'t forget to share your thoughts below. Stay tune for more reviews as well as promos. Don\\'t miss your next favourite book or manga!

I think that may be because the book can actually go in depth a lot more than the short movie. \\n The artwork was really fantastic. Some of the best I've seen, in my opinion. There is so much detail, especially in the chaotic action scenes, with pieces of junk and wood and concrete flying everywhere. Just superb. \\n I really look forward to getting book 2. Unfortunately, my local library doesn't have it, which I thought was odd, considering they had book 1.\"),\n",

       "  \"I am feeling quartered over Two Generals. In one quarter, I dig Scott Chantler's art with reservations; in another, I am impressed by his portrayal of the Nazis, when he happens to portray them at all; in another, I am simultaneously disappointed with his propaganda of Canadian excellence and pleased that he shows Juno beach, the least talked about beach in the Normandy invasion; in another, I am disappointed that the two parts of the Two Generals are all there is. \\n His art: Chantler's illustrations are beautiful. There is a delicacy at odds with their perfect linear geometry that makes the illustrations surprisingly emotive. I didn't expect such emotion to be conveyed by a graphic illustrator whose style is simplicity, but I was wrong. Moreover, Chantler's use of close ups and repetition, mostly used in quiet moments, added a gravity that I appreciated. There was a problem for me, however, and that was that everything was too clean. Chantler shows limbs blown off and a foxhole full of Canadian dead, but even those moments are clean. I am not sure that Chantler's style can ever be anything but clean, which makes it a poor style, ultimately, for the portrayal of war. See, I am torn. \\n His view of the Nazis: The Hollywood view of Nazis as buffoons or Nazis as pure evil is both inaccurate and, I believe, dangerously reductive. Not recognizing that they were regular people, living regular lives, who engaged in terrible things (or tacitly agreed to letting terrible thigns happen) makes it much easier for us to believe we could never do such things, which makes it much easier for such things to happen. Chantler doesn't go the Hollywood route. His Nazis are, indeed, regular folks. Fervent believers, but regular folks. Until, that is, he comes to Rommel and Hitler. The former is the accepted stereotype of the good and honourable German soldier trapped by circumstance, and the latter is the magnetic cult leader of our nightmares (a little more Manson that Hitler, actually). These portrayals, though, are as they are because these historical figures only appear on a couple of pages. I'd like to see Chantler write another of these historical graphic novels about Rommel. I wonder what that would be like? \\n His propaganda: Living in Canada, having been raised by a Canadian Mum in amongst Canadians, having been educated by Canadians, I know how unappreciated Canadians feel for their contributions to victory in WWI and WWII. They feel very unappreciated. It makes sense then that Chantler, whose grandfather, Law Chantler (the protagonist of Two Generals) fought in the Normandy invasion, would write and draw about Canada's D-Day beachhead, Juno Beach. Furthermore, it makes sense that he would be writing to inform us all of Canada's WWII military excellence. But it bothers me just a little bit. I agree that Britain and the U.S. underappreciate the contribution of Canada (and England's other colonies for that matter), but I have a hard time with the desire seek appreciation for contributions to war. And when my reservations are coupled with Chantler's none-to-subtle suggestions that Canadians were the most poorly supplied, the biggest underdogs, and still made the most important contributions at every step of the D-Day invasion -- the crucial contributions that made victory possible -- I can't stop myself from squirming in my chair. \\n My disappointment: Yet I find myself, despite how I am torn by this book, wishing that it was much, much longer. I didn't want this to end. I wanted to see more of Law Chantler's time in Europe, and I wanted to see much more of the Canadian contribution (minus the bias) to the entirety of the war. I hope Chantler continues to write personal histories of people and events. He has a gift.\"),\n",

       "  \"Yes this is a graphic novel. Yes it is about mice. And Yes it is done very well. \\n Petersen has created an entire world around the idea that mice must fend for themselves in a universe far larger than they are. He has given them personailites, towns, and a code. \\n The story in fact, has all the aspects one would expect to find in a story about war heros, myth , legend or fact. It is reminiscent of lord of rings or something else. \\n On one side it feels very much like a summary. The art and pictures are so rich adn the story definately feels deeper than what I am witness to. Being as this is, I beleive, the first of it's kind from Petersen, this is not suprising. Kind of like a pilot on a tv show. Throw you right in just to get the genereal idea. \\n There is a six part series coming out soon about the Winter of 1152, which I feel will be a much deeper story. \\n The Extras at the end prove that this is a world well thought out by Petersen.

       "  'I don\\'t often review comics though I read more than my share. Occasionally, however, there comes along something that really grabs my fancy. More often than not, it is a book about which I am the last to board the train, like Fables. Then there are those rare cases where a book comes along that I want to push on fellow fans of the form. \\n With S.H.I.E.L.D. Architects of Forever, Hickman demonstrates why I so love the Marvel and DC Universes (a feud in which I refuse to engage), with all of the byzantine baggy histories which both have amassed through the decades, often to their editors\\' discomfort but to a talented writer\\'s delight. Some may get bogged down wondering how this book will integrate into Marvel\\'s \"continuity,\" (I suspect it largely won\\'t) but for me, I just delighted in Hickman\\'s inventive blending of historical persona (Galileo, Tesla, Newton, Leonardo, etc) with Marvel stalwarts (Celestials, Galactus, the Brood) and with a few favorite characters\\' fathers thrown in for good measure. Weaver\\'s art is lovely and unusual, proving a fine compliment for Hickman\\'s story. \\n As someone who now reads comics only when collected in volumes, I can\\'t wait for the next volume of Hickman\\'s SHIELD.

If yes, then that's great, f not well, this is the second time I'm featuring Ayumi Komura's work on my blog. The first one was her longest serialization - Liar Lily. I loved the story a lot; so don't be fooled by my rating. I was debating whether to give it 3.5 or 4 leaves, but, in the end, gave it 3.5 because when I looked back at what I read I didn't really like the ending and I would have loved to see more of Hayato and Hanayu. I actually had to re-read the last 3 pages for 3 times to prove to myself that those two stayed together. I really wanted to see their kid or a bit more affectionate those two. But well we get what we get. \\n But let me elaborate a bit, so you are not so left out. Meet our main characters: Hanayu - she's the daughter of patisserie and wants to be a sushi chef, and we have Hayato on the other hand - the successor of Hyuga sushi shop, who wants to become patisserie. Perfect combination if you ask me. They just need to switch places and everything would be fine. Or just marry into each other's family. And well both of them had the similar ideas, but what if their plans are ruined or some of them have some obligations to fulfill? That's for you to find out how they actually reach their happy end. And believe me, they will, but not without many arguments, threats and even break ups. \\n I loved this story. It was fast paced and fun, as always the author made a huge accent on the guys, drawing them really well. I didn't really care about Hayato, his and Hanayu's dads were drool worthy. Well, it's if you love Komura-sensei's art style. I got so used to it after reading Liar Lily that I found it very easy and fun to read. The biggest mystery was the gender of the culinary class teacher. So if you're new to this series, please share your hypothesis with me thanks! \\n What else did I want to cover here? Oh, right. I actually bought all 8 volumes from book depository (the link is above) it's in English. But if you like reading online and prefer mangafox to mangahere, this time, you'll have to compromise. As on mangafox there're only 6 volumes while on mangahere are all 8. I had the similar happen in a few other mangas too. \\n Are you ready to find out how Hanayu and Hayato reach their dreams? Don't forget that this is a cooking manga and you might find some useful recopies or just information there. I actually made a note to cook one of the things there. I hope you'll find some time to read this fantastic story, it does lack in the romance department, but it's still fun and interesting to read!

       "  \"see full review @ Katie's Corner \\n Are you ready for today's review? Di you by any chance note something? If yes, then that's great, f not well, this is the second time I'm featuring Ayumi Komura's work on my blog. The first one was her longest serialization - Liar Lily. I loved the story a lot; so don't be fooled by my rating. I was debating whether to give it 3.5 or 4 leaves, but, in the end, gave it 3.5 because when I looked back at what I read I didn't really like the ending and I would have loved to see more of Hayato and Hanayu. I actually had to re-read the last 3 pages for 3 times to prove to myself that those two stayed together. I really wanted to see their kid or a bit more affectionate those two. But well we get what we get. \\n But let me elaborate a bit, so you are not so left out. Meet our main characters: Hanayu - she's the daughter of patisserie and wants to be a sushi chef, and we have Hayato on the other hand - the successor of Hyuga sushi shop, who wants to become patisserie. Perfect combination if you ask me. They just need to switch places and everything would be fine. Or just marry into each other's family.

It didn\\'t matter that I knew what was going to happen, I was just savoring the moment of reading about my favoruite characters again. I loved all of them; some were plain idiots in some parts like Angus with his love for his brother and how he became a koala every time he hugged him. It\\'s hilarious! Lil is an amazing character; I really loved her from the bottom of my heart. I loved how she was strong one minute and fragile the next. And I just loved the banter between her and Eros (or Silver eyed monster as she called him). They are about 3 years part but Eros looks so much older wen he first appeared. And come on his hoboing style of life was just too fun to read about. The story starts on a good note, but as soon as it progresses, comes in the element of real life, that everything is not as happy as it can be, that there are also sad parts in our life. \\n As I have already mentioned I really loved Lil as a character. Life threw at her many problems, but she always came out strong. And that is one of the reason I loved her. She showed me that if you wanted something you had to fight for it. Would it be your career of your love. And trust me she fought to be acknowledged and loved. Another thing is with Eros. I knew that he looked at Lil differently from the time he her grandma, ad I was like looking forward for him to acknowledge his feelings. It was really fun watching how he was fussing around her, but wen he breaks he heart and he did that a number of time it makes your heart break into million of pieces. And when you actually look back and see that nearly all of the heart beaks were because of his brother you just can\\'t not take Lil\\'s side when she conforms the siblings about the truth. But well everything ends well, or relatively well, because all of the characters are left with scars and some have more visible than the others. \\n I remember when I first wanted to start this story I was quite reluctant, it\\'s about models and its quite long 18 volumes (110 chapters). I knew that modeling was not the easy job, or I heart it was so, but after reading this story I started looking at models a but differently, mostly it was because of Lil, because she was feisty and she didn\\'t want to be one in the very beginning, but when she started she gave her all to her work, ad you just want to admire her. It\\'s not easy to make the picture look animated, but when I was looking at Lil cat walk I actually could see how she walked.

       "  \"see full review @ Katie's Corner \\n Well, this was one of the first mangas that I've read when I started getting into the manga world. There are about 7 other mangas a bit similar to this one, and I will definitely cover them soon. They are in the category mature and smut (erotica), but they are still the best. \\n But let's get back on track. This manga has absolutely everything, starting with comedy and ending with tragedy, having a lot of supernatural doesn't seem bad too. You just can't not love the main characters. Even the villains have your support. I mean it, some of the villains are really amazing. The story is about a young girl - Misao, who can see ayakashi. Let me explain, what ayakashi are, in plain English - demons, but take it a but further, Japanese culture demons. If you are not very common with them, do not worry, everything is explained, and maybe if you are like me a sucker for mythology, you'll start researching about them. \\n The story is very interesting. I focused on love between Misao and Kou. Guess I forgot to tell you who Kou is. This guy is a demon and he's head over heels in love with Misao. He's a big pervert, but you just can't hate him. What kind of demon is he? He is what is called a tengu, a demon with the wings of a raven. As I have already stated, the plot of this manga is very interesting. It has many twists and turns, and the characters are shown from both good and bad sides. The manga is full of romance, however, there are a lot of moments where you just can't not cry. You find yourself laughing at many moments, but there will be a lot of tragic one too. The last 2-3 volumes will make you cry a lot. \\n You will love Misao a lot. She is a character, which makes you smile a lot. You feel her every emotion, her joy, her sorrow, her expectations. The last two volumes, where she finds that she is pregnant are amazing. They will just tear your heart out, and you can't just side with one character. You understand both Kou's POV as well as Misao's the author tears open the hearts and minds of the characters and presents everything to us in a manner as if to say: What would you have done if you were them? \\n I hope you will find some time to read this manga. It is quite long, however, as soon as you start it, you won't be able to stop. Enjoy it to its fullest. The art is really great especially when the author is drawing the guys. Yep, you'll drool on them a lot. Find yourself engrossed in the world of ayakashi: a world full of love, betrayal, joy and sorrow.

       "  \"see full review @ Katie's Corner \\n Well, this was one of the first mangas that I've read when I started getting into the manga world. There are about 7 other mangas a bit similar to this one, and I will definitely cover them soon. They are in the category mature and smut (erotica), but they are still the best. \\n But let's get back on track. This manga has absolutely everything, starting with comedy and ending with tragedy, having a lot of supernatural doesn't seem bad too. You just can't not love the main characters. Even the villains have your support. I mean it, some of the villains are really amazing. The story is about a young girl - Misao, who can see ayakashi. Let me explain, what ayakashi are, in plain English - demons, but take it a but further, Japanese culture demons. If you are not very common with them, do not worry, everything is explained, and maybe if you are like me a sucker for mythology, you'll start researching about them. \\n The story is very interesting. I focused on love between Misao and Kou. Guess I forgot to tell you who Kou is. This guy is a demon and he's head over heels in love with Misao. He's a big pervert, but you just can't hate him. What kind of demon is he? He is what is called a tengu, a demon with the wings of a raven. As I have already stated, the plot of this manga is very interesting. It has many twists and turns, and the characters are shown from both good and bad sides. The manga is full of romance, however, there are a lot of moments where you just can't not cry. You find yourself laughing at many moments, but there will be a lot of tragic one too. The last 2-3 volumes will make you cry a lot. \\n You will love Misao a lot. She is a character, which makes you smile a lot. You feel her every emotion, her joy, her sorrow, her expectations. The last two volumes, where she finds that she is pregnant are amazing. They will just tear your heart out, and you can't just side with one character. You understand both Kou's POV as well as Misao's the author tears open the hearts and minds of the characters and presents everything to us in a manner as if to say: What would you have done if you were them? \\n I hope you will find some time to read this manga. It is quite long, however, as soon as you start it, you won't be able to stop. Enjoy it to its fullest. The art is really great especially when the author is drawing the guys. Yep, you'll drool on them a lot. Find yourself engrossed in the world of ayakashi: a world full of love, betrayal, joy and sorrow.

       "  'Although, I loved the first Avengers movie, I was disappointed with the second one. It felt overstuffed. I do love James Spader and he did a very good job as Ultron but he didn\\'t really do much. My cousin, an avid comic book fan, was dismayed with Ultron\\'s characterization. He felt that he was too funny, too sarcastic, and not intimidating enough. I defended it by saying his \"father\" is Tony Stark and, as such, got his characteristics. \\n However, that was before I read Age of Ultron and was rightfully schooled. Ultron is one scary sentient artificial, homicidal intelligence and he wasn\\'t even in it that much! \\n But that metal face looking at Hawkeye: that\\'s true maniacal crazy. \\n Age of Ultron starts off with The Intelligencia kidnapping Spider-Woman while trying to activate some kind of metallic thing of supposed power. They\\'re also teaming up with Thanos to make this happen. However, the Avengers, in all of their avenging glory, come in and kick ass but they\\'re too late! \\n The metallic thing of power reveals itself to be Ultron who hightails it out of there saying: I am unprepared for this battle. You will wait. \\n Apparently, when Ultron did come back after an indeterminate amount of time, it came with the machine apacalypse and pretty much decimated the world. Now, the Avengers, the Fantastic Four, and the X-men which equals to about maybe 9 are all that\\'s left. \\n That\\'s not really a comforting thought, all things considered. However, Luke Cage makes a startling discovery that will take the team through time and space and bring up the question: should we interfere with what has already been done? \\n I\\'m not going to lie, I was a complete fangirl throughout Age of Ultron. It was just so good and very intense. It has everything I love: a scary villain, time travel, Alternate Universes, Who are we to play God? debates, etc. \\n Although, I haven\\'t read Ultron\\'s first issue, this was easier to follow than the volume of Civil War I picked up. To play Devil\\'s advocate, Age of Ultron isn\\'t 19,000 issues like Civil War. It was an epic and clear story. \\n Brian Michael Bendis, I\\'ve noticed, has written a lot of graphic novels I want to check out from the library or buy. He seems to have a very good handle of the characters and the world he wants to create. I want to read his Alias: Jessica Jones volumes next.'),\n",

       "  \"A must read for any serious DC comics fan. Beyond the fantastic watercolor artwork by Alex Ross, the story is also probably the best DC story from the 1990s. If not, it's up there with The Long Halloween at least. And it holds up still 18 years later. In fact, I'd say it's more prescient now. The old heroes have given way to the new generation. A generation that cares less about collateral damage and the rule of law. And the old heroes, disheartened by human society's acceptance of these heroes have retired. But things have gotten out of control and now humanity feels out of control and sort of ruled by these new heroes. Merely pawns. So sets up a 3-way battle in this graphic novel. 3 different ways of dealing with crime. It's almost a study of anarchy vs. conservative tactics vs. more liberal tactics. And it's fascinating.\"),\n",

I have other examples if I decide to read them). And that\\'s the only real problem with this adaptation. Too many of the clues are glossed over in a couple of panels. The musical instruments used with dialogue (a cool SF trick that added lots of flavor to the tale and worked really well in the graphic novel format) were not all included in the front page, or at least the variations used were unclear. \\n All in all, this was a neat story with a cool world idea (no money, just your prestige denoted by your mask, your deeds and the instruments used to talk with) retold with wonderful drawings. I do feel (like a few other reviewers have said) that quite a bit was cut out of the story to make it fit. Actually, let me amend that. I feel Humayoun Ibrahim, in choosing his panels, thought he was telling a lot more of the story through the art than he really was. There were quite a few details that were lost on me, as someone who has not read Jack Vance. \\n And no, the 12 page \"sing the praises of Vance\" essay that introduces this graphic adaptation didn\\'t really get me interested in reading his stuff. I might pick up a book somewhere at sometime, but I\\'m not rushing out anytime soon. \"The Moon Moth\" was an interesting short ... but if I want awesome SF that is written with a literate bent, I\\'ll just read Samuel R.

       "  \"Narrative-wise, Hawkeye: My Life as a Weapon is a revelation. This book is funny, compelling, and thoroughly engaging. I loved the characters and the entire mood of the graphic novel, which is somewhere between dark comedy and unexpected drama. The only thing that threw me off was the art style, which I think is too simplistic for the complexity of the plot. \\n Clint Barton, a.k.a. Hawkeye, is a hero for hire who is soon recruited by SHIELD to retrieve a package for the organization. Unfortunately for him, the job is a little more difficult than SHIELD made it out to be. Combine Barton's big mouth with a whole bucketful of assassins and thugs and you have a recipe for disaster. \\n But if you think one Hawkeye is good, then what about two? Despite all the espionage and running from gangsters, Barton still finds time to team up with former Young Avenger, Kate Bishop, otherwise known as Hawkeye version 2.0 (the female one). \\n As I said, I can't fault the narrative. I found it thoroughly entertaining, and there aren't many holes or issues I can point out. So a big kudos goes out to writer Matt Fraction for his amazingly well-thought-out and hilarious plot. Too bad that level of awesomeness didn't find its way to the art as well. \\n I would not be exaggerating by saying that I hate the art in this book. The duo responsible is David Aja and Javier Pulido, whose combined effort comes off looking like something from an airline safety pamphlet. The anatomy is blocky, even with the female characters, and there is no shading to speak of. Not impressive at all! \\n Put simply, even with all the issues with the art, I would still recommend this book for any superhero fans out there. \\n Cross posted from The Other Press\"),\n",

       "  'Why do we love Saga this much? \\n This question can absolutely never be answered with shitty answers like \"the art\\'s damn beautiful\" or \"the story is great\". Sure those are the attributes of this graphic literature by Brian Vaughan and Fiona Staples, but you cannot give justice and won\\'t be able to fully describe how good Saga is with those one-line descriptions. That is how f*ckin great this series is. So if you haven\\'t read it, my god, can you just buy and read it? \\n Volume seven embodies all I love about this comic. There\\'s so many that I might not be able to tell them all, or not in a systematic sort of way, but let me start with saying something that most of us would agree on: Saga\\'s characters are just perfect. Perfect in a way that their imperfections and all that constitute their persona are the ones that drive the story to greatness. A good story cannot be fully realized or appreciated without awesome characters. Characters who are human, both brave and cowards, flawed yet they try to be who they aspire to be. Marko, Alana and the group aspires to be a family (with a tranny horn, a ghoul and a droid) despite their differences. The Will dreams (literally) of his past so that he can think about his future. Gwen aspires to make the galaxy to be a bit better places despite the horror of her actions. \\n Their voices may ring of happiness and quips, but ultimately, you\\'d feel a tone of loneliness, almost lost in the vastness of space. \\n All these characters have voices, and if you hear them in the wonderfully constructed words in the bubbles, you\\'d hear them so loud yet so distant in the vastness of space. Their voices may ring of happiness and quips, but ultimately, you\\'d feel a tone of loneliness. F*ck, even L.C. has feelings! \\n Brian Vaughan lashes out his own political views about themes like war, spiritualism and the blind following to religion, the savagery and self-righteousness of those who are in power, terrorism and sexuality. I didn\\'t buy those things in his Ex Machina but I did here in Saga. Again it is in the characters, in their point of view and in those little conversations that those views become very personal and very endearing, and before realize it, these themes are already inside your system. \\n Fiona Staples has never been this good. Her illustrations have a perfect mix of ruggedness and love that it gives Saga its visual tone. I mean, that issue #37 cover alone is perfection perfected. I love the nuances in the emotions of the faces she draws. The sense of wonderment in these pages has been effectively conveyed by the illustrations. \\n The only (very minuscule) disappointment I have with this volume is that I was expecting to see a bit of skirmishes, since after all this arc is The War for Phang. To those of you who haven\\'t read this book, don\\'t expect a battlefield. Nonetheless you will be thoroughly entertained as I did. Even cried a little at the end. Oh yeah, this is really not spoiler because it is a common thing in Saga, but yeah, something happens. Haha, damn you Brian K. Vaughan! Thank you too.'),\n",

She is a Muslim Pakistani-American and she is so easy to relate to - her struggles with her family and their expectations of her vs. her desire to fit in and be just like everyone else, her fangirling over The Avengers and her excitement over having posted a popular fanfic, her struggle with her self-image and self-worth due to the European beauty standards that rule society, just... \\n her \\n ! \\n How adorable is she?! \\n There's Kamala's friend, Nakia, who is not here for you to give her some westernised name when she has a perfectly beautiful name already. \\n And who is a proud hijabi. \\n Then there is the faux-liberal popular girl, whom Kamala desperately wishes to be like, even though she is, to put it plainly, a horrible person who disguises her racism and islamophobia under the guise of non-intersectional feminism. \\n Which quickly reveals itself once Kamala breaks out of the preconceived ideas she had of her, and what she could or could not do: \\n Some POC are extremely fortunate in that they always had a very strong sense of self-worth, and found comfort in their ethnicity and cultural traditions - I wasn't among them, many of us aren't, and it can takes us a long, long time to embrace and love who we are, so it's really touching to have Kamala illustrate the result of trying to be someone else to fit in: \\n So let's see: family life and the struggles of being an adolescent girl, non-intersectional feminism, islamophobia, xenophobia, racism, issues concerning self-worth, religion, standards of beauty imposed by the media, trying to fit in - all that, dealt with in the most amazing way, in a short issue! \\n And it ends with a cliff-hanger that has me wanting to run out and get the next issue right now!\"),\n",

Here we have a group of paranormals taken in by an evil corporation who wants to use their powers for their own good. Pair that with the teen psions of the New Universe's Psi-Force, and you pretty much have the elevator speech for Valiant's Harbinger. \\n Of course DP7 wasn't written by Shooter himself, but instead the excellent Mark Gruenwald, who would ensure that DP7 had the most consistent writing for the whole New Universe. And, rather than it being a teenage fantasy (like Psi-Force or Harbinger), DP7 instead tells the tale of more mature adults suddenly yanked out of their lives by their new powers. \\n Those mature adults are really what make the book. It's a deeply characterized story, with all seven of the protagonists quickly become real people -- and people that are pretty far outside of the norm of typical superhero comics. \\n And these comics, they're dense and slow to read. Compare it to the decompressed stories of the modern day and it's a sea change. The comics actually take time to read. You can't just plow through them. But unlike some of the other comics of the time, they remain interesting to read. The text is actually about something, not just Pow! Ka-Bang! \\n The plotting of DP7 is the weakest element. The seven flee from the clinic, they're hunted by the clinic, they meander around, and they're hunted again. By the end it pretty much feels like we're where we started. If not for the great characterization, this would be a major problem. \\n Despite that complaint, DP7 was one of the strongest New Universe comics. It may well have been the strongest in its first year, before some of the other comics found their footing.

It has people coming back from the dead, but instead of as mindless monsters, they are confused people trying to make sense of their new life. It also has a very strong and unique central Wisconsin feel. As a lifelong resident of Wausau, Wi., where the series takes place, it was amazing to see locations that I drive by every day and reference to places and things that are regularly mentioned here. Seeley is also originally a Wausau native, so he knows the area well, but he clearly did a lot of research also. It was a surreal experience and so much more interesting than reading a comic book set in Metropolis, Gotham City, or even New York. I do not think that you have to be from Central Wisconsin or even any part of Wisconsin or the midwest to appreciate it, but it is of particular value to people who are familiar with the area. Either way, Seeley creates such a vivid and interesting character in how he portrays the area, it can be of universal interest. Be warned, howver, the real city is not as cool as the version in the comic and does not have as colorful individuals.

That was years ago, and I remembered that I was totally hooked every episode. \\n Now that I am significantly old for the material, I never really knew what to feel at first reading this shoujo manga, Orange. But as the reading progresses, the beautiful yet sad story unfolds unfolds right to my eyes and directly to my heart. I felt young again, a time when innocence and ignorance from all the responsibilities are still unseen in the horizon, a simpler time in school, where my everydays are motivated by childish love, friends and crushes. And of course, those heartbreaks. Oh, those were the days. \\n Orange has a special story about love, regret and friendship that is ought to be read by all. It plays with the heart's all-time question of regret: if I can change the past, what would that be? For future Naho, it is for her past self to save her dear friend Kakeru. \\n Orange plays with your heart, excellently blending teenage love and friendship with heavier themes like loneliness, regret and the value of life. The sci-fi elements of time travel is there to set the plot of the whole story. \\n I have never expected Orange to be that moving even at my age. After finishing volume one of the complete collection, I do care about the characters, not only with Kakeru and Naho, but all of them. \\n Orange also is a window for foreigners to see the Japanese society, at least how their youth behaves, and there's some romance with them not being straightforward emotion-wise. There is definitely a darker side in this story though. It is the reality of suicide and death.

It is a starting point for exploring the different artists as much as it is to see if the mythology of The Sandman was interesting enough to investigate further. This is an anthology that explains where graphic novels are/were. This is a quiver of arrows ready to be shot off into the future of the literary form. \\n And yet, it is only one. It worked its magic on me because I am still new to the artform and still looking for the best works.

Once I got into it, Tommy's story is a lot of fun, and I wish I'd get to read the rest of the books in the series as well! \\n Tom Taylor's story is the opposite of fun. In fact, it's deeply disturbing. Since he is conceived around the time that his father comes up with the idea for Tommy Taylor, the two of them become intertwined, at least in the father's mind. Instead of keeping this idea to himself, Wilson Taylor tries as hard as he can to milk this for all it's worth, going as far as to ensure that his son is born on the day that the first book is released, and fitting the infant, whose eyesight is perfectly fine, with tiny little Harry Potter (or should I say Tommy Taylor?) glasses.

The first one I covered was Love Attack and you can find the review on my blog. I\\'ll be covering 2 more works, but that\\'s for future. However, let me tell you one thing that I have found out about Seino Shizuru\\'s works. All of them or mostly all of them are linked. If we take this one as a core, then its spin off is Love Attack and that has a sequel of its own, and after comes another spin off from Love Attack. I\\'ll read and find out how Heaven foes into my theory, but I\\'ll think about when I read. \\n But let me return to the story. I liked it, but it wasn\\'t something unique. It reminded me of Rumored Midori-kun by go Ikeyamada, though the circumstances of the female leads were totally different.as I already mentioned the story is not all that unique, a girl has to cross-dress because her dad wants her to become a basketball player. The story started very well, but I somehow lost the thread because the it somehow lacked something. If you ask me it just plain lacked romance in every of its essence. However, I would have been fine with that if the story took a different pace, but even in that section it disappointed me. There were no \"Big\" or major games and such stories at least need those to justify themselves. But let me stop with all of the things that disappointed me and focus on something good. \\n Well...

       "  \"I feel bad giving this two stars, but it doesn't do anything to rise to three. It's not bad, it's not really even at the level of average though. The art is fine. The story is...well, confusing as we start in media res with Daredevil having a sidekick. Maybe this was set up elsewhere, but the sidekick seems to exist only to propel the plot along. \\n It manages to tick the boxes of a Daredevil book without ever quite feeling like a Daredevil book, and as much as I didn't dislike it, I never really felt the story kick in. There was a very flat feeling to the plot, as if it were hitting the mile markers to get through and never really dropped into gear. \\n The art and coloring are sometimes muddy in parts as to heighten this effect, with the end result feeling like empty calories. Everything in the book by itself is fine, but nothing ever really adds up or feels as if there's something being said. Daredevil feels as if he could be swapped out with any other character and the arc really just feels like it happens because the plot needs to happen. \\n A rare miss from a creative team I usually really enjoy.\"),\n",

       "  'Bloom, while far away from being a mediocre Batman story arc is not the one that I have expected from Scott Snyder. He\\'s been killing it for five years now, giving us a series that continuously satisfied our Bat nerdiness, both in depth and action-entertainment. \\n This arc though, it doesn\\'t live to the name of Snyder and Capullo. I liked the concept of Gordon as Batman, he\\'s funny and sarcastic, constantly saying his disgust over the idea, yet he does it anyway. The cowl (or I say, the armor) is just too heavy for him to handle. Mr. Bloom on the other hand, I really don\\'t get what he is trying to prove. He says he\\'s the cure, \"entrusting\" the power to the people of Gotham through his seeds, yet he\\'s also a murderer, a mob, an I don\\'t know former Gotham city supergenius in nanotech gardener. You see, Mr. Bloom though the action in his story were bloombastic (hehe), he\\'s out of place in Gotham City. \\n The better part of this arc are definitely the quiet conversations. You know, Bruce\\'s talk with Alfred to let him become the Batman again, I felt pity for Pennyworth, like as a reader, you want him to be back but you feel the other side too. Batman\\'s talk with Gordon was gold too. You know, they\\'ve been through hell so many times and Gordon, with an apologetic tone tells him how much he has failed the city and especially Batman, his ally and most of all his friend. \\n But the most endearing of all was Bruce\\'s heart to heart talk with Joker (yes I know it is debatable but for me he\\'s Joker) by the lake. That place, the peaceful place only the two of them knew was like their exclusive bro-zone. And I love how these two characters, in their own ways struggle after what happened to them post-Endgame. Two lost souls, life-long enemies just there talking about what has become of them. I felt for Joker. He doesn\\'t want to be the Clown anymore. \\n Bloom, even though I don\\'t want to admit it, is my least favorite arc in Snyder\\'s run. Even the two-part Clayface story felt better for me. I didn\\'t hate volume 9 though, far from it in fact.'),\n",

       "  \"This volume changes the format a bit in that the creator now has a team (previous volumes were entirely done by him) and it's released as an ongoing monthly. So the art changed some. It's arguably a little better, certainly more colorful, but I don't think it's as stylish. I actually quite liked the old art in it's goofiness. This takes on a more comic realism, I guess. \\n The story was okay, not great. I expected more coming out of Las Vegas where it is set. It mostly revolves around a prostitute ring headed by another living zombie (like Janey) that is either Elvis or an Elvis impersonator. He has living people working for him that he frequently kills. The zombie types must have stupid ridiculous strength because Janey karate chops through a guy cutting him in half and the King (as he's known in the book) splats two lackies heads together like overripe tomatoes. So Janey makes herself out to be this herald of women, defending against sexist douchebag types, but she clearly plays pretty loose with rules because she seems to kill fairly randomly anyway. Some of the fight scenes were kind of stupid, some of the story was kind of nonsensical. \\n So far this book is trending downhill. If it continues I'll probably just stop reading them, but I'll give one more volume, maybe two, a chance. They are short and quick to read. I just might come to my limit on how much trashy T&A comic I can handle.\"),\n",

       "  \"Head Games continues the story of the Locke family from Locke and Key, Vol. 1: Welcome to Lovecraft. So don't go on reading if you haven't read that one just yet! \\n Now that Sam's threat has passed, the Locke family is starting to feel safe again. So much, that Duncan is going to be away for a while, and the children are in charge of Nina. Unfortunately, Nina is still reeling from Rendell's death and the recent events at Lovecraft, so the kids get plenty of time on their own. This leads to the discovery of another magic key: the Head Key. \\n The Head Key is a highly intelligent concept, besides being important for the plot. It opens heads, literally. Creepy, but cool. This key represents self-exploration, the knowing of one's weaknesses and strengths. Who wouldn't want to get ride of their fear in some situations? Or to be able to know just about everything ever written? Just cram the book inside your head, literally! I get the excitement of the Locke kids. \\n However, the Lockes are unaware of the new threat, far more dangerous than Sam ever was: Dodge, who is now very close to them under the identity of new student Zack Wells. He has gotten his way into the family, being a friend and listening to both Tyler and Kinsey, something they aren't used to, given their status as victims. With Kinsey's fear out of the way, the danger is looming as Dodge gets rid of everyone that could have identified him. \\n Unlike the characters, we know who the evil guy is. For a while, the novel turned into a slasher, and nothing more. However, Joe Hill had an ace up his sleeve. The final twist about Rufus blew my mind, and I loved the backstory even more. Although the pace of Head Games is slower than that of Welcome to Lovecraft, and there isn't that atmosphere of dread and terror, I still want to know more. This series is addictive!\"),\n",

       "  'A book that takes place in the DC universe. While this one has appearances from the well known characters like Superman and the Joker, this one is an adventure that concerns sidekicks. There are several different story lines that weaves into one and the one story line is Darkseid is behind it all. \\n One story line is Jimmy Olsen has gained new powers and he has no idea how. Another is Mary Marvel has lost hers and is searching for help. The third story is Holly Robinson is fleeing from Gotham and the final one is Jason Todd and Donna Troy is recruited to search for the Atom who is missing. I am not a die hard DC fan and I believe this is a hindrance in reading this novel. I had to look up online who these characters were. After I did this, I had no problem with the story. Only two out of the four story lines kept my interest. Mary Marvel and her quest for power and how she is seduced by it was my favorite. I liked Holly\\'s story as she teams up with Harley Quinn and I laughed out loud with this \"buddy cop\" team up. The other two are vital to the story but I was never engaged by them. \\n Why the four star rating then? I used the GraphicAudio rendition of this story and it was incredible. They employ different actors, sound affects, and a musical score. They put out a top notch product and they could probably make the yellow pages interesting. \\n This novel would probably be more enjoyed by die-hard fans of DC. The casual fan might be a little confused by the characters but the story is easy to follow. Do yourself a favor and get the audiobook. It makes it so much better and you won\\'t even notice the unfamiliarity of the characters. You will be so engrossed by the action and the story.'),\n",

       "  'see full review @ Katie\\'s Corner \\n Today I have a manga, which I enjoyed a lot when I first read and well even after second reading I enjoyed it a lot too. Well, that might be due to me forgetting half of the things that happened, but while I was reading I was remembering too, and it didn\\'t really lose its moment of revelation. I seriously forgot whom the girl chose at the end. In the very beginning I thought that the story would take the similar twist as in \"No Longer Heroine\". But well, it didn\\'t. \\n All the characters are very interesting and especially their interactions. Every character has a story to tell and at the end of the whole manga there\\'s even more to tell. It would have been really interesting to make a sequel about Nina and Shun; there were lot of moments of them, but still 3/4 if the story Nina is madly n love with Kou. To say the truth, it was not the first time that the story ended in such a manner, but it was definitely the first time I agreed with the choice. What I mean here, is pretty simple, Kou was an absolute let down as a guy. It was quite simple to guess that he really did love Nina, but he waited and waited and even started going out with Yuiko... I mean, what the heck? You finally admit your feelings when she kinda moves on? Though I actually understand him. Both of them were too used to each other, their relationship was already developed, however, and I mean it, I wished until the 8th volume that Nina would end up with Kou. But at the moment Shun was acting as a lot better guy, so I switched. I loved Kou for the final chapter, when he pushes Nina to tell her real feelings. \\n A character, which I despised with my whole being was Yuiko. I was okay with her in the 1st chapter, but as soon as her \"I-thought-I-liked-you\" attitude came up in chapter 2, I was shaking. She was just using Kou to fulfill her need to be N1. If you ask me, if she didn\\'t kiss him, Nina and Kou might have had a full chance at giving their relationship a go. Thought she was also the one who pushed Nina to tell Kou her feelings. I guess it\\'s a complicated situation, but I still don\\'t like her. She had to work on their relationship and not whine al the time. Look at Shun, he made Nina fall in love with him and they\\'re keeping their relationship even thought they\\'re in different schools. \\n I believe this manga is best described with one word: Love. The author gives us lots of cases if love, and gives even more relationships. The author as if gives a nudge to all of those who are in an unrequited love to speak of their feelings. It\\'s better to be late then sorry, though it\\'s not so good to be late too. I believe this work will raise your spirits a lot; it did so for me. I lived every page of it and it was the same when I re-read it. There are many everyday situations with fun moments, but there are also some sad ones, though the happy ones always override them. \\n I hope you\\'ll find some time on your busy schedule to read this great story. Enjoy it to its fullest and don\\'t forget to share your thoughts below! Stay tuned for more reviews as well as promos! Don\\'t miss your next favourite book or manga.

       "  \"5 stars, for sure! \\n Budjette strikes again, although this time he teams up with Bow Guerrero and J.B. Tapia. The one-decade work in progress resulted in a fantastic, page-turner that can make you forget the things you have to do as you sink into its pages and the jarring introduction of Mikey Recio into the dark reality and his family's legacy. Amazing stuff. \\n Mikey Recio & The Secret of The Demon Dungeon takes a different view of the colonization of the Spaniards over the Philippines, which mixes with our current folklore, like the tiyanak. I'm not sure if there will be other 'monsters' in the next book, but the tiyanak is the one at focus in the first volume. The Catholic traditions of the Filipinos is also highlighted. Who here has experienced praying the rosary during road trips? I certainly did, and up to now, that's still a family practice. I was able to relate to Mikey's irritation and boredom with said practice, as well as his inclination to simply listen to music instead of praying (hehe). \\n At first, the introduction was not as exciting as I hoped it would be, but it was an excellent way to set the characterization of Mikey Recio and set the tone for his transition in the next half of the volume, and perhaps for the rest of the storyline as well. And anyway, after about five pages, I was suddenly absorbed into the comic book, and I sat stock still on my bed after ten minutes, just reading, until I saw that my sister was about to leave without me. \\n I do consider this as a sort of Catholic fiction, and although that is not my cup of tea, the integration of Filipino practices and religious beliefs with the folklore monsters has definitely captured my interest. I think it's an interesting take on our culture, and, well, a more kick-ass, tangible reason for praying the Hail Mary. \\n The first story is short, almost like a character backgrounder for the whole story (which will hopefully span across 20...50 volumes?). The second half of the book is like the history of the start of the Order of St Michael in the Philippines, and some of the earliest (fictional...I hope) recording of the first person to survive an encounter with the Fallen Ones. \\n I also laud the art and differentiation of the characters in the first volume. I'm not much of a graphic novel art aficionado, but as a simple reader, for me the visuals were fantastic and definitely brought the characters and settings to life. The team-up by these three creative guys is a good one! \\n If you're looking for your Filipino choice reading material for this month, or whenever, I do recommend giving Mikey Recio & The Secret of The Demon Dungeon a good chance. \\n Review as posted on My Book Musings\"),\n",

How awesome is that? \\n Those 2 stars are all for that, plus the absence of gratuitous sexualisation and the amazing art work. \\n The story was just too shallow for me - yes there are some heavy subjects approached like, alienation and empathy and what it means to be human, but Mara herself wasn't a particularly developed character. Nor was anyone else, come to think of it. \\n This just read like a stereotypical super hero origin story, with a distinct disconnection between characters - I suppose that's deliberate, to show how Mara was becoming more, but still... \\n It seemed like Watchman ultra-light, with Mara as a young adult female Dr. Manhattan. But with none of the grittiness of the position. \\n Even when we get flashbacks to her parents saying goodbye to her before she was turned over for training, it all seemed so... superficial and sanitized. \\n Also, \\n I get that they're trying to make the reader's focus shift to the philosophical implications of her new state, but really... this needed a why. \\n So, to summarise, awesome artwork, kudos for a character representing several minorities (not that any of these minorities' issues are ever approached...)... and not so great on the character development and cohesive narrative side of things. \\n It felt more like an exploration of philosophy 101.

For me, and I\\'m quite tolerable to Bl in mangas and animes, it was not a dire situation, as I perceived Mashiro as two people. I though of him as male with Kureha and female with Sou. That made my life much easier. So, if you can do the same thought focusing solely on Sou\\'s and Mashiro\\'s kissing scenes, you are up for it! Start reading it; you\\'ll enjoy the story for other reasons too. \\n Another thing that I wanted to discuss is, I believe, the whole concept of this story. The intrigue of the whole nightmare world is still present even when I finished reading. I mean it\\'s not plainly said what it was all about. I believe every reader has his/her own opinions about it. Mine? It\\'s as complicated as the whole story. Though the ending does leave us hanging. It\\'s like finally everything worked out between Mashiro and Sou and bam! Mashiro is graduating. But that had to happen, right? The author leaves he ending open to our imagination. Will those two be together in the end? It does imply that they will meet, but will they have the similar feelings as in their \"nightmares\"? \\n I hope you\\'ll find some time to read this great story. If you love complex stories with a lot of mystery and psychological aspects, this story is for you! All the characters are more than complex; they astonish you even in the last chapters when you thought you\\'ve figured all of them. Hope you enjoy it to its fullest and don\\'t forget to share your thoughts below! Stay tuned to Katie\\'s Corner for more reviews as well as promos. Don\\'t miss your next favouirte book or manga!

       "  'My Bronte loved this graphic novel, and I can see why. It\\'s a feel good story full of classic \"monsters\" -- mummies, skeletons, goblins, demonic insects -- but they\\'re all cleaned up and as unscary as can be. There is a simplistic good versus evil tale going on (albeit with a nurture rather than nature bent). There is a lovable grandfather, who was a poor father, looking for and finding redemption. There is a sacrifice for love. It hits all the right notes for the kids who are its target audience. \\n Unfortunately, it\\'s all too Eisner-Disney for me. It\\'s too scrubbed, too sanitized, too simplified, too happy, too sweet. If it were a sandwich it would be two pieces of Wonderbread with peanut butter and jelly slathered an inch thick between the slices. That\\'s too much for me. These days I like me pb&j with minimal goo in the middle. \\n Don\\'t get me wrong, though, there are much worse tales out there, and since Bronte and I have been talking about the book since she finished and I started, I fully back her decision to read the book again. She loves the artwork (again ... too cleaned up for me, but it is pretty), and the story gives her joy, so that\\'s good enough for me. I don\\'t have to love the books she does; I\\'m just glad to have a chance to experience the things she loves and to talk with her about them.'),\n",

       "  'Far too short. It seemed the storyline was going in a good direction, but there just wasn\\'t enough revealed for me to entirely know what was even going on. It almost seems as if this is a spin off from some other comic book, where the majority of readers already are familiar with the characters and situations. There were occasional flashbacks to fill in the blanks, but I thought it was just not enough. What was here, though, was fairly enjoyable. Some of the one liners from death were fantastic, such as this \"All I see before me is air and dead men no longer needing to breathe it.\" NICE! The characters all seemed cool enough, but as I said, just not enough there. I have no idea what Death\\'s goal even is. Why do the other Horsemen want to kill him? I\\'m sure more would be revealed in following volumes, but it\\'s just so damn scarce right now. \\n The art was quite good. Really loved the use of color. The linework was phenomenal. Some panels were weaker than others of course, but I\\'m sure some of that has to do with size and deadlines needing to be met. Overall I really liked it. \\n And what/how/why is the Tracker/Hunter\\'s eye sentient?? And why does Death have these Indian witches, Crow and Wolf, with him when he seems fully capable on his own? And on that matter, if he was supposedly killed once, except not really, he seems awfully invincible now. He doesn\\'t even blink an eye at the ensuing People\\'s Republic elite army at one point. I prefer my (anti-)heroes to at least have some chance of failing, even if it\\'s just superficial. He does have a weakness, for his wife, but hardly. \\n I\\'d definitely pick up the next volume at some point. If it\\'s still scarce for characterization, motive, and backstory at that point, I would like this series less. So for now I\\'m going 4 out of 5 stars, and we\\'ll see how subsequent volumes show.'),\n",

First of all, at the time I am writing the review (it's October FYI), the story is completed but it's not fully translated in English. I can even say there are more chapters translated and uploaded in Russian. I will be making two reviews, I might make a third one, but I'm not 100% sure about that, as first I'll need to read the story to the end and for that I guess if by the time the review hits blog, which is right now, there's no new updates, I'll have to buy last 6 volumes in German. Though I'll have one advantage. I'll resurrect my German skills. Good bargain if you ask me. \\n But let me get back to the review! I'm covering 1/3 of the whole series, and I stopped right where the author says: end of part one. So that I do not mix two different lives together. The story is fantastic and it is the longest so far in Ikeyamada-sensei's works. It is fun, it is sad and it surely is a story worth reading. We follow 2 love lines: one is Sayaka x Hikaru and another Chihiro x sShinobu. The part that I'm reviewing our heroes are in middle school. The story starts with them being 13 and meeting each other. Will, technically Chihiro & Hikaru are childhood friends. It is very interesting to read hos Hikaru & sayaka fall in love with each other, and how at the end of the 33 chapters Shinobu & Chihiro finally start a relationship. \\n All characters are fantastic. I especially love Chihiro, but I'll cover her character next time, as what I wasn't to talk about will spoil the next chapters. Let me concentrate on Sayyaka & Hikaru and the ives of 13 -year-olds. I loved those two. They made a couple that you would like to be you. I really wished that Hikaru was real. He's a fantastic character. The way he conveys his feelings to Sayaka as well as how he is always when she needs him, makes him a perfect boyfriend. In the very beginning, I was not Sayaka's biggest fan, but the more the story went on the more I understood that I love her character. She's shy, she's introverted but as soon as she starts acting she becomes a character that you just can't take your eyes off. I love how they confessed to each other. And that moments when both of them are jealous their make-up s fantastic. Sometimes I even forget that they story was featuring middle school kids. The emotions are overflowing and you are wondering what is going to happen when they are featured as high school kids? Trust me, what I've read by now it was amazing and I can't wait to know how the story will end. \\n I hope you will start reading this amazing story. I know I'm not fair recommending a story that is still being translated, but trust me you'll love this story and the character. If you are looking for a story with lots of love, some drama and action than this story is just for you. Explore this amazing world of acting, basketball and school life.

       "  'This Sex Criminals has got to be one of the most interesting premise you could ever have in a story. It is a hybrid of adult fantasy, comedy and heist genres with a handful of fourth wall breaking. In Sex Criminals, a couple met and discovered that they are not alone in this planet with their powers that could literally stop time whenever they orgasm. Crazy, right? \\n With sex jokes and pranks ranging from sexual innuendos, to crass dick jokes and to creating a total ruckus in a local porn shop, Sex Criminals is never really serious in storytelling. After all, orgasm-induced powers would make anyone think about the craziest and crappiest thoughts whenever they go into this so-called \"The Quiet\" or \"Cumworld\". \\n With all the weird flashbacks and fourth-wall breaks that serve as devices to introduce our main characters, the main hest plot seemed to look very underwhelming. Although it is easy to be back on track whenever you lose your way in a deliberately loose narrative structure, the story altogether felt shallow and the characters, uni-dimensional. Well, at least I had a lot of fun reading it. \\n I\\'m not really a fan of the illustrations though. That may have a significant effect on why I didn\\'t like (nor hated) the characters. But I put it this way: maybe it will take a certain amount of time for me to be accustomed and finally appreciate the drawings. \\n Sex Criminals may be worth your time, but there are definitely better material than this.'),\n",

       "  'Overall, X-Statix is a beautiful, innovative, funny comic. It was ahead of its time and it looked at superheroes from weirdly slanted views. The 40-issue run had its ups and down, and it definitely overstayed its welcome by the end, but it\\'s still a terrific run, and I\\'m happy it\\'s finally been collected as a whole.This run was also when I fell in love with Allred\\'s work. It\\'s very clean and iconic and is a strong element of the comic as a whole. \\n New Beginnings (116-120). The idea of turning superheroes into spoiled celebrities and then seeing what happens was awesomely innovative back when these issues were originally published. The idea has been used a bit more since, but Milligan still offers a strong, fun take on the topic. Character-wise, three stand out: The Orphan, U-Go-Girl, and Doop. In many ways, this X-Force was the story of the first two and how they changed and adapted to the weird world they found themselves in. It\\'s great to see them again. [10/10] \\n Lacuna (121-122). Huh. Two issues spent one recruiting that\\'s not even successful There\\'s some fun discussion of race and genre tropes here, but this doesn\\'t have the strength of the early issues [7+/10]. \\n \\'Nuff Said (123). I\\'ve never been impressed by Marvel\\'s no-words month. This came off better than most because of Allred\\'s artwork, but beyond that it\\'s totally skippable [6/10]. \\n I have no idea what to make of The Brotherhood crossover, but after reading #9, reprinted here, I wasn\\'t particularly enthused to go read more. Still, I guess it\\'s nice to have every X-Statix story in this one omnibus. \\n Edie & Guy (124). Some nice background on Edie, but after this I was happy to get back to \"bigger\" stories [7/10]. \\n Space (125-129). This was the story that reminded us that no one was safe, and it was a great reminder that this X-Force wasn\\'t a typical superhero comic. Beyond that, we get great media manipulations and a fun storyline [7+/10] \\n Good Omens (1-5). A strong revival of the series. It\\'s great to see the followup to Edie\\'s death, and also terrific to see the media focus on the O-Squad, which helps to reiterate many of X-Force\\'s themes. I thought it was slowing down in the last issue (which unfortunately has horribly ugly non-Allred art), but then the ending hit me right between the eyes [8/10]. \\n The Moons of Venus (6-8). A nice focus on Venus that really develops here as a character, and other than that some silly fighting [7/10]. \\n The Movie (9). An OK issue without a lot of depth to it [6+/10]. \\n The Diaries of Edie (10). A very nice character piece, both for U-Go Girl and for Venus [7+/10]. \\n Wolverine / Doop. Milligan\\'s pure weirdness style didn\\'t intersect much with X-Force ... but it does here and the result is delightful. This very strange adventure is the perfect blend of the weird and the heroic ... and you can still see this foundation for Wolverine and Doop\\'s relationship in Wolverine & The X-Men, many years later [7+/10]. \\n Short Character Stories (11-12). These are quite good. El Guapo\\'s story is a funny one [7+/10] while the focus on Dead Girl is a weirder and crazier one of the sort you\\'d expect from Milligan [8/10]. \\n Back from the Dead (13-18). This story runs a little longer than it should and has its highs and lows. Some of the events are quite shocking, and the horror at the end of is good, but it also feels like Milligan is increasingly using shock for pure shock value, not for innovation. Still, this is an enjoyable read [7+/10]. \\n The Cure (19-20). A very nice character piece on Myles, at times touching and funny and revealing more about him than we\\'ve seen in the whole series [7+/10]. \\n Avengers vs. X-Statix (21-25). I\\'ve never been thrilled with this penultimate X-Statix tale. It tries to be clever by playing with an old trope of super-team teamups, but for the most part it\\'s a dull fight. The Iron Man vs. Mr. Sensitive issue is very clever, but the rest generally aren\\'t [5+/10]. \\n Are You Ready? (26). Simultaneously, an expected but daring ending to the series, reminding us of what made it strong in the first place [8/10]. \\n Dead Girl. And this is a much more apt ending for the comic than the final arc of the original series. It\\'s a funny, wacky tale that also does a great job of letting some of the X-Forcers be heroes one last time [7+/10].'),\n",

I just want them to magically appear near me, but then again I'm dreaming too much. \\n I remember as soon as I started the story I feel in love with every character, okay not every but at least with four main definitely. It isn't only one love story, but I think about 2 or even three. The title is red string, if we translate word for word, but somehow sometimes it's translated as innocent scene.

The story may be your average love-story, where the girl loves one boy, but due to some circumstances a \"delinquent\" is chasing her and so in the end she does fall in love with him and they start to date. You get my point? Well, add to the mix the school that forbids love (relationships) and you get a rough story of our heroes. Oh, I forgot to add that there would be some love rivals to test our lovebirds\\' relationship; you get my drift, right? \\n I loved the story a lot. It was really good and with a lot of funny moments that would crack you up even if you had the worst possible day ever. The best parts of curse were Saika\\'s. The way she transforms from a nice and ladylike into a killing machine is something fabulous. Oh, and her futile, but not always, efforts to shake of Shin\\'s advances, can\\'t leave anyone laughing. On he other hand you have Shin. Well, he\\'s from that male population that says: \"I want it and I\\'ll get it.\" In the very, very beginning, he\\'s just a frustrating negative character, but to the end of the 1st or 2nd chapter, he becomes your either first or second favourite characters, depends how you like Saika. \\n I enjoyed this story a lot. I mean really a lot. The whole concept of a school, which banned relationships, was quite new to me, not really new, I\\'ve either read or watched something with similar idea behind, but how Oda-sensei managed to describe it and actually bring it to life is absolutely amazing. The way characters interact is as if you were just plunged into high schiil, I mean, I graduated high school about 2 years ago and it was the first time I missed it, because it was too similar to my own high school years. I really enjoyed reading about Saika and Shin\\'s relationship. They cracked me up, but at the same time their interaction was sweet. I was having a lot of fun reading about Shin. Whenever he was turned down and afterwards got his revenge on Saika. The way they looked for secluded places to be alone at school. But that just arose a question within me: couldn\\'t they spend their spare time together? Was it really necessary to \"fool around\" at school? \\n I hope you will find some time to read this story. It\\'s fast paced and you just can\\'t put it down even for a minute. Are you ready to get acquaintance with Saika, Shin and many more amazing characters? Then, what are you waiting for?

       "  'see full review @ Katie\\'s Corner \\n Yes, yes, it\\'s a smut genre, but it\\'s not all showing as Minami Kanan works, but do you see quite a lot. But let\\'s get back to the story itself. The story may be your average love-story, where the girl loves one boy, but due to some circumstances a \"delinquent\" is chasing her and so in the end she does fall in love with him and they start to date. You get my point? Well, add to the mix the school that forbids love (relationships) and you get a rough story of our heroes. Oh, I forgot to add that there would be some love rivals to test our lovebirds\\' relationship; you get my drift, right? \\n I loved the story a lot. It was really good and with a lot of funny moments that would crack you up even if you had the worst possible day ever. The best parts of curse were Saika\\'s.

       "  \"I was trying to decide whether I should rate this tome of a samurai/ronin comic as 4 star or 5 star as I was going through it. I decided when I finished that 1) I wanted more of it and 2) my main complaint was lifted at the end and 3) I would definitely read this again, that I would have to rate it 5 stars. \\n The main complaint I had was that I didn't know what a lot of the Japanese words used within the writing were. The words varied from generally common knowledge words like ronin (masterless samurai) to bugi (an apology, iirc, but I'm probably wrong) and many things in between. Turns out, I realized when I finished, there is a glossary at the end! Wish I knew that going in. \\n The artwork improves as the book continues on. Many times there were issues with knowing who was who (including the main character) though that improved as well. Most of the time it doesn't matter much because, besides the lone wolf and cub characters, no one is repeated between issues/chapters. \\n In fact, everything about this improved as the story went on. At first it was just kind of short one offs about this character that didn't seem to have any story to him. Then it's revealed some of his backstory, which is interestingly a fictional take on a real person (among many historical tidbits), and then even some of what he does passing on. I can only guess that everything continues to improve as the series (12 or 14 HUGE 700+ page volumes worth!) goes on. \\n Definitely going to look for the next big book to buy.\"),\n",

       "  \"In 1993 and 1994, DC's young Vertigo universe had its first (and last) title-wide crossover. It started with a story by Neil Gaiman that told about children disappearing, then it continued through five of Vertigo's annuals, telling how the young powered people of those people were being taken as well, and then it concluded in a second story by Gaiman (and others) that told how it all resolved. \\n Twenty years later, DC has finally decided to collect this series, but they opted not to include the annuals in the middle. It's an understandable decision, because the annuals were largely focused on the individual stories of those titles. While a complete collection would be a nice sampler of that era's Vertigo, it wouldn't necessarily tell a nice story. In exchange, DC commissioned a new story to set in the middle, to tell a more on-point story of how those powered children were kidnapped to Free Country (and otherwise bridge the two standalone issues). \\n It was a worthy and thoughtful plan, but unfortunately not one that worked. \\n The first issue of The Children's Crusade is brilliant. It's like a lost issue of Gaiman's Sandman. It focuses on the Dead Boy Detectives, and is very much their story, interspersed with mysterious histories of how children came to Free Country in days past. \\n But then we get to the new story in the middle, and it's very dull. The authors just didn't have much to work with, so we get the Dead Boy Detectives wandering about and super kids showing up in Free Country ... but there's no tension, and really no story. \\n Sadly, the second issue of The Children's Crusade is a bit of a mess too. Instead of being a good bookend, bringing the focus back to the Dead Boy Detectives, it's instead all over the place. It spends as much time on Tim Hunter as anything. Though it has at least one nice surprise and does some good things with some of the super kids brought to Free Country ... it's not a great conclusion to the story that Gaiman started in issue #1 due to its changed focus. \\n So, I'd contend that the structure of this crossover was flawed from the start. It's neat to see interactions between Black Orchid, The Books of Magic, Animal Man and the Dead Boy Detectives, but the story doesn't pay out. I think it's still worth having if you're a fan of classic Vertigo, but don't expect Sandman or Books of Magic greatness once you're past the first issue. \\n And I also have to annoyingly ding DC for publishing this as a Hardcover, but not a Deluxe Hardcover, which would have allowed it to match the other hardcover Gaiman books they've done recently.\"),\n",

       "  'Crazy? Yes. This volume really does switch on the crazy button. Ignoring some of the \"reveals\" (which don\\'t feel like they make that much sense with where this whole series started ... but then again, the conspiracy has to go farther to hide the fact that it just started with a simple story), I dug the Tetora storyline here. He has a purpose, his understanding of the system is kinda explained, but at least we see him really doing something. \\n It is sad that Dark Horse stopped bringing over the manga at \"File 68\" when there are at least 83 out there. Why the story stopped now ... I can only imagine. I mean, the reveal at the end is in line with my Twin Peaks comparison a couple of volumes back, but still. There is a lot going for this series even if it isn\\'t perfect. \\n You\\'ve probably noticed that none of my ratings have been below a 3 star rating for this manga despite how much I rant and complain about the random aspects. That\\'s because I am very intrigued with the whole story/stories/whatever complex thing this is. Is it too complex for its own good? Probably. But that doesn\\'t mean the artistry isn\\'t amazing, the asides (something that was featured more in the first volumes, but still appears every so often afterwards) are the appropriate level of humor, the way the twists in narration are slowly developed and the character focuses are changed is masterful ... yeah, this manga series is quite cool. I do have to wonder, though, does it truly have an end? \\n Did Otsuka create something that was stripped of his creative control and now he is forced to stretch this story way beyond what it should have been? Is that why this series hasn\\'t ended yet? Why won\\'t Dark Horse release the rest of these comics to let the US readers decide? \\n Oh well, it\\'s not like I haven\\'t found a website that has it all for free anyway (and it was a very simple search too). And yes, I plan on reading as much as I can of this manga. I like it too much to just stop.'),\n",

       "  \"Pretty serious comic with lean in the horror and macabre. John Constantine is neither good nor evil, but he sure does some bad things to his friends, of which his ghosts constantly haunt him. Whether those ghosts are all in his head or real is questionable, especially since there are demons and zombies (the voodoo variety) and all number of ghastlies. \\n The first few issues start out almost like a police procedural. Begins with a little snippet of something awful happening to someone and Constantine sort of has to work it out and save the day. There are bits and pieces to hint at Constantine's history, but nothing really revealed yet. This arc has mostly to do with a fanatical religious cult against a demonic cult and Constantine kind of gets in the middle, particularly his short term lover. \\n The artwork is the old style, cross hatching for shading and solid muted colors. The drawings are ok, but not really my favorite style. I definitely think coloring has improved dramatically over the years. The lettering is ok, but not always sharp. I was reading this on a kindle and when it was a two page spread, my app had problems so it was very hard to read, but I managed. \\n The writing is pretty good. Deeper than I expected, and certainly more internal than modern comics tend to be. The action is light and fairly short. Having been my only introduction to Constantine was the Keanu Reeves movie previously, this was somewhat surprising, but not a problem by me. \\n The demons were creative and the storyline was, while depressing and rather seedy, interesting. I look forward to the next in the series to see where it goes.\"),\n",

The story was interesting, but it just seemed like there was probably a lot more to it, but it got left in the author's head rather than being put down on paper. A body appears in multiple eras, roughly 50 years apart, though the time really has nothing to do with anything. It's almost entirely 4 separate stories, barely connected apart from the central theme or character, that of the body itself. There is a cultish group and the main characters are unique, sorta, at least to their respective eras. Symbolism takes a big part, but it's never really explained. There is a repeated phrase, but that's not really explained either. It makes the story as a whole rather mediocre. \\n The cover is really what made me read this, and I think is the big reason why there are so many really low ratings. It makes you think it's about some murdering housewife from the 40s-50s, but she's not even a character at all. Very disappointing. Bodies isn't even a good title, to be honest. \\n The art is broken up by the era. 4 different artists. I liked most of it, for the most part. Nothing that stands out too greatly.

I hate that the author hasn't been writing, but she has her problems, therefore I can only guess what happened in the end of the story. But let me tell you why I both loved and hated this story. \\n This story is very realistic; I could even say it's too realistic. The way the characters interact, live, the way their story or love develops. I have read similar stories, if you take Aoki Kotomi's stories; they have these same feelings, the premonition that something bad is going to happen. It doesn't help that the story is narrated with the tone of regret. As if we are reading a journal or something like that. And the feeling gets worse when we get to the future flashbacks, or if we say it correctly the whole story is a one big past flashback and the so called future moments are the real present time. But let me introduce you to our characters. \\n If you have read the summary you know that the story is focused on two girls, who share the same name, but their lives are absolutely different. However, they become best friends and they will have to overcome many difficulties together. Osaki Nana - a musician, a singer who is in love with the guitarist of a very popular band - Ren. If you ask me she's the worst character ever, I mean she's selfish: she wants to be with Ren, but at the same time doesn't want Nana to leave her side and be with Takuma and the worst is that she wants Yasu to always be in love with her. She's too self-centered and she just destroys everything in her life. Especially if my hypothesis is correct and the relationship between Nana (Hachi) and her first kid was ruined because of her. But let me talk about mother Nana - Nana Komatsu. In the beginning I thoughts she was plain stupid, I thought so even until the middle of the story, but somehow I changed my opinion of her. Mostly I didn't get why she still stayed with Takuma, if she knew what an infantile person he was. But then I thought, she really did love him and no matter what you think Takuma did love her. He didn't know how to handle women, he also cheated, but in the end he did return to her. What I really loved about him were his words when he thoughts that Nana was pregnant. I mean before, about a chapter ago he was so against kids, but as soon as he was in front of the fact he didn't care if the kid was his or another guy's he may not be an ideal man, for that he would need to understand women, but he was perfect in some ways. \\n The story is full of sadness and love, especially unfulfilled but at the same time fulfilled love. It makes you wonder if the life is really like that. You get to meet many different characters, and remember that all of them are damaged in some ways. Will they be able to become whole or will they get more damaged in the end? That's for you to find out, as this story us fantastic in its way.

Some are crazy funny, some are deadly serious. Despite the differences in tone, though, they all mesh together surprisingly well. \\n Enough about how I came to this book (the last of the bundle that I read) ... let\\'s talk about Chinatown and the Mystery of Mr. Wicker. \\n For the uninitiated, The Goon is a big hulk of a man that\\'s all muscle (well, not dumb, but definitely more muscle than mind in general). He\\'ll be diplomatic and try for a peaceable solution ... unless it comes to zombies - this particular book lacks the \"slackjaws\" - when he\\'ll fight first and ask questions if he thinks it\\'ll do any good. Due to his violent job - a hired goon for unions, a vigilante against others creepin\\' on the territory, a big fighter - he\\'s a scarred brute with a bit of a smart mouth and a pistol-happy sidekick. \\n This book is all about how he got his scars - including those on his heart. \\n Sentimental as that sounds, Eric Powell does a very nice job of transitioning between two timelines; paralleling a modern story with the memories of The Goon. There are not nearly enough origin pieces in this to fully call it an Origin Story, but this is pretty close to what drives The Goon. There is a lot less humor in this particular volume, and the supernatural elements veer further away from horror than in other comics, but even so feels like a great introduction to the characters. It\\'s easy to get lost in the caring of these people and feeling the emotional strings get tugged. For a story that ends as violently as this does, that\\'s incredibly powerful and makes Powell one of the masters of using violence to help make points. \\n In short, pick this up and spend an hour or two in this world. It\\'s a quick jaunt in, but one that will leave you shuddering with excitement for more. Could this have had even more story thrown into it, sure. I was hoping for a lot more regarding Goon\\'s first days in the carnival, but when the only complaint is \"this was too short...\" you just have to suck it up and start reading the other volumes that exist. \\n I truly hope that The Goon movie does get made if only to help introduce more people to this fun, violent, moving series.

       "  'X-23: Innocence Lost (v1 #1-6). What if Weapon X were retold with a vulnerable girl taking the role of Wolverine? That\\'s the basic premise of Innocence Lost by Kyle & Yost, but the story goes far beyond that. The scientific team is more amoral and manipulative, but with a few characters who we root for, creating a much more deeply textured story. And, it\\'s really the characters and emotions that set this origin story apart: issue by issue, the tension ratchets up, and we can\\'t believe the horribleness can continue ... but it does. \\n A wonderful beginning to X-23\\'s story that explains how she became the wounded girl that we saw in NYX. My only complaint is the captioned use of a letter spread out over the six issues, which ends up being distracting. Otherwise, this is a pitch-perfect story. [9/10] \\n X-23: Target X. Kyle & Yost\\'s follow-up nicely dovetails with the \"Innocence Lost\" series, picking up both the chronology and the characters. It\\'s terrific seeing Laura interact with the real-est family that she has, while the battle against arch-nemesis Kimora is wonderful too. With all that said, there are some structural flaws in this volume: the scattered timeline of the first issue is very hard to follow and the frame sequence between Steve and Matt is mostly annoying. [7/10]. \\n Captain Universe / X-23. An awful take on the uni-power, where it\\'s an intelligent, talking, thinking entity. Combined with that we get a largely non-vocal Laura, who is a plot device, not an actual character. The result is dull and meaingless -- just a step toward the next event in the crossover [1/10]. \\n [It\\'s definitely worth rereading New X-Men: Childhood\\'s End here, which I did, and perhaps worth rereading the first Kyle + Yost X-Force, which I didn\\'t.] \\n Women of Marvel. A better one-off, because it actually focuses on Laura\\'s character, even if it gets too artsy-fartsy at times [6/10]. \\n The Killing Dream (X-23 1-3). I love this comic\\'s focus on Laura\\'s full continuity. The contrast of her time with the New X-Men and with X-Force is particularly strong. It\\'s also great seeing her interact with several different X-people and really be her own person. \\n On the downside, this story is messily meshed with what I assume must have been the Wolverine-in-hell story, and it doesn\\'t make as much sense without that. There\\'s also a bit too much mind-meddling and dreams, much like in Liu\\'s \"Women of Marvel\" one-off, and that\\'s less than thrilling. \\n Still, this is an interesting start. If Liu sticks with the great characterization and the great continuity and not with the annoying mind games and the annoying crossovers, this will be a strong series [6+/10]. \\n Judgement. A short starring X-23 and Ghost Rider. They fight some racist thugs. Laura gets a tiny bit of characterization. [5/10] \\n Overall, a varied but good collection. Kyle and Yost rock, which is no surprise given their track record on other X-Men comics. Liu is OK. A bunch of shorts are barely worth reading. The collection is definitely worth reading, though, and I look forward to the next.'),\n",

Well, truth be told, I did check it and thought it was completed, but it appears that the author just dropped the project and here I was having so much fun reading it, especially it was getting somewhere very interesting. \\n This story is nothing special. However, it held my interest through out the story and I never once wanted to put it down. So haters hate it, but I really enjoyed it and was pissed a lot because apparently the author dropped the project and there have not been any news if she is going to continue it. As I have already mentioned the plot is not all that unique, it's a crossover of Skip Beat! and Allegro Agitato. However, the only similarities that I have found was that like in Skip beat the story is about acting and it has that small similarity in mother and daughter relationship like in Allegro Agitato. But its not all that escalated. Okay, enough with the whole compassion. I liked the tory a lot. It was fun. Even though I am not a bug fan of harems, I'm series it's always driving me crazy how the girl gets all that attention while she was a total wallflower for the past years. Doesn't that piss you off too? But here I was having lots of fun just reading how the guys were coming to terms actually liking Yura. I still have a hard time coping with the choice that Yura made. But then again she fell in love with a wrong guy. And it's really a pity as the story ends on a cliffhanger and I am so pining for her to end up with Haruka. They would make an awesome couple. \\n The issue that I want to focus attention today is Yura's mother. You despise the woman right from the beginning. The way she treats her daughter is awful. And I don't know if you will think of her differently, but I certainly felt pity towards her when her story is told. She was too vain and even though I do not like how she treats Yura, I still understand her some parts she wanted to be the center of everyone's attention; her husband's especially. But the was more in love with his daughter then her, but then again it was understandable. He did marry her only because she was pregnant. She never achieved the love of her husband, but taking it out on Yura was a bit too much. \\n I guess I confused you too much, but hopefully I did intrigue you so you will read the story and understand what I'm talking about. I'll go read the story and understand what I'm talking about. I'll go and whail I the hopes of getting some news from the author. I really want to know how it all ends. It's not fun just imagining.

The characters all feel authentic, and the focus on Connor is particularly great. Meanwhile the plot of turning rich people into vampires feels like it\\'s right out of the TV show. It may be an \"episode\" rather than something truly epic, but it\\'s still a fun one! [8/10] \\n The Crown Prince Syndrome. Sadly, not as strong as Willingham\\'s previous volume. There\\'s still some fun here, and the characters still seem right, they just don\\'t get as much time for characterization. The main problem is the plot, which is all over the place and gets really muddy in the last issue. And, we shall not even speak of the art, which is very uneven and has one horrid issue (#5). [7/10] \\n The Wolf, The Ram, and the Heart. Even more sadly, this final story continues the downward slide that ran through Angel\\'s last three stories. There are theoretically some good ideas here, like a trip into the future, a final confrontation with Myr, and a touchback on Wolfram and Hart that recalls the whole series. Unfortunately Tischman\\'s writing is quite hard to follow, such that events seem to come out of nowhere several times. In addition, the art is again uneven, like it was in Crown Prince, and the second issue of this arc has some of the worst art I\\'ve ever seen in a comic. [6/10] \\n Not an awful ending for this Angel series ... but not a great one either. \\n And then we come to the short add-ons: \\n Eddie Hope. The idea of a vigilante punishing people for what they did in Hell-A is cool, as it shows that that After the Fall continues to matter. However the execution is dull, probably due to the strip\\'s serialized nature which feels repetitive when put together [5/10]. \\n Yearbook. It\\'s good to have the yearbook to finish things off, because these are generally strong stories, though not particularly deep ones. The Lynch story at the very end is the best, for its retrospective on the Angel series as a whole [7+/10] \\n I\\'d generally recommend this hardcover over the individual volumes, as it\\'s the only way I know of to also get the Yearbook in a collection (and Eddie Hope, for what that\\'s worth).'),\n",

It looked a bit like a cartoon version of the show, instead of a graphic novel. \\n Greg Scott was my favourite artist in this volume, his artwork was the most realistic - this is a matter of preference, of course, so don't let it sway you in any way. \\n Regardless of which artist was featured, it didn't really help that the review copy I was provided with had this plastered over crucial dialogue: \\n While the Flukeman is my all-time favourite creature, Chitter was my favourite issue in this volume. \\n Tributes to a Chittering God... that one is going to haunt me... \\n Issue 10 actually made me glad this was a graphic novel because I would have lost sleep over what was going on if that had actually been shown on tv, instead of an ebook I could set aside and take deep breaths to remind myself that this isn't actually true. \\n Anyway, an amazing volume, and a must read for any X-Files fan! \\n P.S. - Oh, and this wouldn't have been the X-Files if this hadn't happened at least once, so I'm glad it did:\"),\n",

       "  'After watching the movie, I picked up the manga with high hopes. Most of those hopes were shattered in the first few pages. The storytelling feels disjointed (purposefully so, as the different threads of the story are all told at the same time, weaving the different plots through two or three panels on one page), leaving me with that much more work to piece together all the characters and their motivations. While the movie fixed that problem (while jumping around enough to match the manga it was based off of), the movie left out many interesting and important parts that the manga filled in. Parts like how ruthless White is from the start; how Black gets the wound from the Minotaur; what was happening while White was in custody of the police and how far down Black goes into his madness spiral. All of these things are hinted at in the movie, but in the manga they are fully developed and make much more sense. \\n So in the end, the first half of the manga was told in a much better fashion in the movie, but the second half of the movie was done in a much more fully realized way in the manga. I do recommend reading this if you truly enjoyed the movie since it makes the themes of the movie clearer and also helped me better appreciate the details of the movie, since many of them were taken straight from the manga. \\n This is one of those books, like Fight Club where the movie and the book are great complements to each other, each one being so close to the other that it is hard to tell which interpretation (print or film) is best suited to the story.'),\n",

       "  'Enemy of the Stars (90-94). Claremont takes over the Exiles, and there are immediately some changes for the worse. First up, he takes the tight 2- or 3-part stories that Bedard wrote, and instead offers up a lengthy, stretched 5-parter. Stupid fights and a simulation fake-out (a Claremont favorite!) help with the stretching of the story ... but don\\'t make it any better. Beyond that, some characters suddenly start acting out of character: Power Princess leaves for pretty much no reason, despite the fact that she had purposefully joined the group; Blink starts throwing shards that do damage rather than teleporting people; Heather claims to be a mutant; and everyone starts distrusting Morph in a way they hadn\\'t in previous issues. In return we get some Claremontisms, like his trademark snappy dialogue and references to the Claremont eras of X-Men and Captain Britain. These are sort of fun, but don\\'t stop the downward trend of the comic [4/10]. \\n Home, Again (95-99). Fortunately the next arc really picks up. The focus on mystery within the Crystal Palace is pretty cool ... and if Claremont introduces new plot elements there and sweeps old ones under the rug, at least his new Crystal Palace backstory isn\\'t [i]totally[/i] contradictory to what\\'s gone before. (My biggest problem is that the bugs wouldn\\'t have left; they\\'d have picked a new team, as we\\'ve demonstrably seen.) The Victor Von Doom world also offers some nice fake-outs. On the downside we get some poor characterization (like Miguel falling instantly in love with not one, but two different women over the course of the arc), and a last issue that feels like a space-filler. Still, it was mostly a fun read. [6/10] \\n Die By the Sword (1-5). A New Excalibur / Exiles crossover was actually a pretty good idea because of all the connections between the teams. Claremont makes good use of that in the first couple of issues, which are full of interesting character moments. Unfortunately, from there it turns into a big long fight that proves uninteresting. Some elements of the story are also dragged down by the fact that they\\'re not meaningful unless you\\'ve read both comics [5/10]. \\n Home is Where the Heart Is (100). A trademark Claremont downtime issue, which goes pretty well, except at the end when he ruthlessly shuffles the old Exiles off stage so that he can write about a new team in his new comic [6/10]. \\n Exiles: Now & Then. A pretty cool (non-Claremont) issue. The writing is at a much better level, and it tells a neat story too, about the Exiles taking on the role of the entities they once despised ... in a clever way [7/10]. \\n Overall, this volume is definitely a step down from what came before, but not nearly as horrible as I\\'d been led to believe ... just \"meh\".'),\n",

       "  \"** spoiler alert ** \\n I've just finished reading the first five collected volumes of Marvel's current GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY title, and this is really a review of that entire run to date. \\n To begin, I'll note that Brian Michael Bendis seems to have a good handle on each of the core characters, and in particular has a knack for entertaining dialogue and interaction between them. The art is consistently good to great, and some of the overall story arcs are quite intriguing. \\n Why, then, have those been so unsatisfying to read? The problem is part of a bigger trend with modern comics. First, because pretty much every title these days ultimately winds up collected into trades, there's a tendency to shoehorn every storyline into a number of issues that suits that format. As a result, some events seem absurdly prolonged, while others seem to be wrapped up rather abruptly. \\n Further, it seems the publishers often don't trust a title to have enough appeal on its own merits, so they continually insert a variety of guest stars. This run starts with Iron Man coming along with the Guardians for a while with little explanation, then basically disappearing later with even less. The same happens at various times with Neil Gaiman's Angela (previously seen in Todd McFarlane's SPAWN titles), Captain (formerly Ms.) Marvel, the Flash Thompson version of Venom and Nick Fury and S. H. E. I. L. D. (Sort of). Even Howard The Duck turns up on a cover for no discernible reason. And, of course, The X-Men. \\n That latter crossover underscores the biggest problem to be found here. Multiple times throughout this series, events take place in another title that are central to what's actually being presented. On more than one occasion I found myself double checking to be sure that I hadn't missed a volume, or even whether there were pages or issues missing from a volume. One storyline hinges on an event that took place years earlier, and many rely on complex synopses of events that took place in other titles. StarLord goes from a cosmic playboy to being involved with Kitty Pryde of the X-Men, first through long-distance holo-dating and ultimately to being engaged, all without the reader seeing them meet, a first date or romantic encounter, or a proposal. \\n The fifth volume us particularly egregious in this regard, with the bulk of the book giving us parts two and seven of an obviously much larger saga which would have been far better served by being collected into its own single volume. While a few other snippets are tacked in, w see neither the beginning, middle or the end of this story (each handled instead by a page-long synopsis), even though it involves major repercussions for the Marvel universe. The result unsurprisingly feels like a sampler rather than any sort of cohesive whole. \\n The original concept of the graphic novel was that these titles would collect noteworthy stories in a manner that was easier to read \\n and more durable than standard comic books. When we're given this sort of hodgepodge instead, it becomes hard not to wonder what the point is. Given that each of these books has a $25 price tag, it's not unreasonable to expect them to deliver some sort of a cohesive whole. Despite some flashes of potential, these just don't do that. \\n Buyer beware.\"),\n",

       "  \"This is surprisingly good, surprisingly so because it is a short graphic rather than lengthy text-based description of one of the most difficult 'schools' of Western philosophy which I am reluctant to label 'existentialism' following Appignanesi's own scepticism about the term. \\n Let's start by saying that it is not really introductory at all. If you want a cogent introduction I would start with one of the many other general textual introductions - I began with Mary Warnock's many years ago but Appignanensi has delivered one of his own quite recently. \\n Appignanesi compromises little in his limited space in trying to reach deep into the thought of the 'existentialists'. Many readers are going to find it very obscure and difficult without a grounding in the history and ideas on which the text is based - but I think you might like to persevere. \\n If you have read already in the subject, he has insights that make the difficulty worthwhile. What I like is his avoidance of the tum-ti-tum standard narrative that takes us from Kierkegaard and Nietzsche via Dostoevesky through Heidegger to Sartre and Camus. \\n He restores the often forgotten core of the school, Husserl's phenomenological turn, and then sets the very different yet dialectially challenging Heideggerian and Sartrean world views in the context of the critical business of choice and survival in the second quarter of the twentieth century. \\n Occasional digressions into the broader literary culture and into the politics of the era are suggestive and apposite. The book is the philosophical equivalent of a haiku - many deep thoughts compressed into surprisingly small space. The images entertain but do not distract. \\n I would argue that this school of thinkers still provides the greatest challenge to the liberal group-think of our age. The logic of their thinking towards intensive introspection and liberal science (Husserl), Nazism (Heidegger) and Marxism (Sartre) remains thought-provoking. \\n Attempts to moralise the last two out of their decisions and choices would be seen as futile by any decent 'existentialist'. The silences and refusals to apologise epitomise not the worst but the best of humanity faced with our technologisation and simplistic expectations. \\n The post-existentialists have contributed important criticisms of the existential turn. Foucault in particular has helped us to understand the nature of power relations and Derrida the role of the text but the turn has been taken too far - there is a cultural evasion here with political effects. \\n The 'existential' turn is terribly terribly dangerous to modern liberal society. Yet it is true to our relationship with Being. The challenge of this critique has scarcely been explored. The result is that modern liberal society has been taken by surprise as the new populism emerges. \\n Elite liberalism has been in denial for far too long about that relationship to Being and our personal choices in a world of roles and material things. The panopticon approach, the attempt to create social hegemony, could never succeed against the raw resistance of those who think apart. \\n Somewhere and somehow radical thought will reappear to take this problem that existence precedes essence and the phenomenological anaysis of our situation and so create the humanism required before transhumanism is possible - and offer a 'poetic' attitude to being in the world. \\n Personally, poetry bores me. If something needs to be said, let it be said, and, if not, let it be experienced in direct relation to Being. The text is the very source of our alienation. Yet Heidegger's stance suggests that that which is poetic or spiritual links to the human core. \\n Husserlian 'scientific' investigation of the mind's relationship to itself, Sartrean concern with our performance in the world and Heideggerian investigation of our relationship to Being provide (in this book) the start of an inquiry into a sufficient rebellion to preserve us against new intelligences. \\n We are in the midst of a revolution in which the post-moderns and the academics appear increasingly surplus to requirements much as monks became in the age of printing. A philosophy to cope with this exists already in the formative work of this school if only we knew it. \\n A sound if difficult and challenging guide to a difficult and challenging way of thinking.

Many of the important elements are not clearly explained. \\n On the other hand, those who have read the novel or watched the movie will feel like they have to recall many things from the novel/movie.

That is disappointing since the very reason we have bought this one is to appreciate the story in another medium and not to experience a mediocre version of it. \\n The artwork is a little less than good.

       "  \"Originally Posted on Confessions of an Opinionated Book Geek \\n I have been waiting for this volume to come out for so long I forgot most of the synopsis. The only thing I remembered was that superheroes were involved, and that was it. Since I went into this pretty much blind, I was really surprised and pleased by what I read. This is a very modern take on superheroes, and it's unusual because a big part of the plot is this whole idea of tradition vs. modernization. \\n Usually superheroes are never involved with the government outright. Typically, they don't have direct power over governments. They merely protect the people and protect themselves with their secret identities. In Jupiter's Legacy, many superheroes feel this is something that should be rectified. Walter is a seasoned superhero who has a big plan to fix the economy of America, but his older brother Sheldon (who lead him and a group of friends to their powers decades ago) refuses to allow him to interfere with the government in such a large way. The power dynamic between the brothers is something that is pretty common, with the older and more responsible Sheldon vs. the younger and more idealistic Walter. Of course, you don't see it with two of the most superpowered siblings in the world. \\n Then we have Brandon and Chloe, the son and daughter of Sheldon and his (also superpowered) wife, Gina. Both are celebrities, and both are no strangers to scandals. Brandon has a drinking problem and Chloe is recovering from a recent drug overdose while also discovering something shocking. With their parents, it's no wonder they're a little messed up. Something so normal as living up to your parent's legacy is something that is made more complicated with superheroes for parents. As Brandon is seduced by the power his Uncle Walter promises and the opportunity to do some good, Chloe has her own problems to deal with along with her secret boyfriend, Hutch. Something happens and the world has changed. \\n I enjoy the characters too. They're all so complex with such relatable problems despite their superpowers. Brandon and Chloe's aforementioned pressure from their perfect parents, the difficulties of being in the public eye, wanting to use your abilities to better your world, etc. It deals with needing recognition and respect from those you look up to and also growing up when the going gets tough. \\n The formatting is interesting because there are various flashbacks to how Sheldon and his people acquired their powers, a mystery I still don't know the answer to. Time fast forwards a few years as the plot continues. I really love Quitely's art as well. The roughness of the lines really shows that this is a dark story, and the light colors of the background make the superheroes and their costumes stand out even more. The way each person's powers are drawn is fantastic and makes it really easy to understand the more complex powers. \\n Overall, I thought this was a very solid first volume. It was a great set-up for future volumes and I'm really curious to see where it goes, and if I'll have some of my questions answered. I'm curious as to what exactly everyone's powers are. It appears every superhero can fly haha. There are glimpses to very unique powers, but I want to know specifically who can do what. I'm also excited for how this war between superpowered beings will go. \\n I recommend this for fans of Marvel and DC and superhero comics in general. As with all Image Comics series though, this is for older audiences as there is graphic violence and nudity. I would say 17+ is appropriate.\"),\n",

       "  \"Just in case you have missed it, Viz Media released three compendiums of Junji Ito's works: Gyo, Uzumaki, and the newest one, Tomie. \\n Viz Media's Tomie compiles Ito's 14-year work in this beautifully bound tome of horror. To give you a background about this episodic manga's main character, just remember these four things about her: \\n 1. Tomie can seduce about any man she meets. These men will do anything just to get her. \\n 2. These men will ultimately want to kill her, often times chop her to bits. \\n 3. But Tomie almost cannot die. She heals most of her nonfatal wounds very fast. \\n 4. Whenever a body part is chopped off of her, that part spawns another living Tomie. \\n When these four things are combined, a genuinely eerie cycle of gore, murders and tons and tons of bitching Tomies. \\n Tomie's stories are told in chapters, vaguely connected with each other. I can even say that it is a collection of standalone short stories that have a beginning act, a second act and always a horrific conclusion. This book gets its strength from the harrowing details of Junji Ito's illustrations, giving it a uniquely dark psychological feel of a world totally ruled by this girl Tomie. Like his other works, Tomie gives the readers an uneasy feel of a large-scale, town-wide claustrophobia where everybody is trapped in this seemingly insurmountable problem. This theme can be seen in his other works Gyo and Uzumaki. \\n Collecting more than a decade of Ito's works, a reader can also see how the author gradually hones his crafts through the years. The only downside of it is that there is no story development at all. The chapters are good by themselves but they really do not add up to something that can be a worthy conclusion of the whole series. Like how do we stop this girl from invading and multiplying, or how to stop her from luring men to their demise. The last chapter offers tiny bit of resolution but nothing is really resolved at all. I think what Tomie needs is a protagonist. Someone who will be our eyes of the story's progression and the key as to how Tomie can be stopped. \\n I recommend this Junji Ito manga if you are really into horror stuff. It is nicely bound and has some very disturbing imagery inside.\"),\n",

Even better, he uses his \"1 year earlier\" timeframe to setup current continuity in the way that Morrison should have but never did. Unfortunately, beyond that Hybrid is a pretty dull comic, full of fighting without enough characterization or subplot. In other words: Nu52 House Style, as usual [5/10] \\n Unfortunately, when Lobdell takes over after Diggle\\'s very short run, we move from a skilled writer trying to work under horrific editorial constraints to a more mediocre writer doing the same, and it shows. Atomic Knights has some neat imagination of new fellows and foes, but it\\'s otherwise a very dull story that borders on laughable super cliches.

       "  \"As a huge fan, I never imagined I could not love something created by James Robinson. His Starman in particular stands out as one of the best series efforts by a major company in the superhero genre, offering a full mature modernization on many a tired trope. Yet with Earth 2, he seems to go completely off the rails. Now this problem may in part result from the odd decision to take a bunch of names of classic comic characters (Flash, Atom, Hawkgirl, Dr. Fate) and slap them on characters who have nothing in common with their original Earth 2 counterparts save their powers (and sometimes not even that). Several are simply unrecognizable: Mr. Terrific an ego maniacal sociopath? Okay. The Flash a cocksure teenager? Okay. Sandman part of an elite special forces team? Yeah..... Why not just give us new characters with new names and be done with it? For a sophisticated writer, Robinson also defaults to some of the most tired comic cliches (while I loved his take on Wotan's origin, I was pained when it came in the sort of pointless super villain monologing that I hoped we had done away with after Pixair's The Incredibles). \\n On its face, I am all for alternative comic universes. That DC continues to spend such time and effort treating them as a problem (all the way back to Crisis), boggles the mind. Taking familiar heroes to new situations surely thrills writers and fans alike. And the premise here, Superman, Wonder Woman, and Batman all dying in effort to drive back an invasion by Darkseid offers a lot of potential. That said, it just doesn't come together. This is perhaps made only worse by DC's tragic and boneheaded decision to absorb the Wildstorm Universe (in which the editors had the guts to actually destroy the world and leave heroes near hopeless among the carnage without any indication that they planned on a reset) into the new DC continuity, thus extinguishing a bold comic experiment. \\n A final note: Nicola Scott's just delicious art bumped this book from two stars to three. Indeed, were I less disappointed her work could have bumped it to four. Her clean bright style evokes Perez yet she surpasses even his skill in crafting action. Here is an artist readers could grow to love and I can't wait to see her talent unleashed on a book worthy of her gifts. Yes, she is that good.\"),\n",

       "  \"Unfortunately, Simone's unceremonious departure from this title damaged it just as badly as I feared. First, we get an infinite number of Firestorms, totally muddying the waters of the title (and taking any character time away from our protagonists). I was actually initially pleased to see Firehawk brought into the Firestorm concept, but she turns out to be a total non-entity (like pretty much everyone else). And then after six issues of this foolishness, the author decides to sweep it all under the rug. \\n Meanwhile, the comic is also embracing the worst house style excesses of the Nu52. Supporting cast are unceremoniously escorted off-screen, while we get a hopelessly decompressed ever-cliffhanging storyline that's mostly fighting. It's exactly what I hate about the Nu52's bad storytelling, and it's something that Simone had mostly avoided when she was in charge. There is a bit of good storytelling in these six issues, but it's about two issues worth of story at best. \\n Oh, and we get storytelling that's quite muddy too, often making it hard to tell what's going on. I dunno if it's the artist or the new writer, but it was unfortunate, especially in the first half of the volume. \\n The 0 issue that ends things is a little better. I mean, it's a coherent story (other than the fact that I was surprised to learn that Ronnie and Jason had lost their abilities in the previous arc), and it actually restores the Jason + Ronnie + (faceless) supporting cast dynamic. The return of classic Firestorm was a bit more surprising. I mean, I guess I shouldn't complain whenever DC ditches a Nu52 concept, but they seemed to have something else that was working here (when it wasn't being written horribly), so it was kinda backsliding all its own. \\n Anywho: a very disappointing follow-up to Simone's interesting beginning.\"),\n",

       "  \"Roy Thomas (GS 1+2) largely offers a two-issue argument as Doom and Namor try to convince each other to work together. I actually liked the first issue (which was a frame for reprints) better than the second. That was because the reprints (Submariner #20 and some issue of FF) were nicely constructed tales. In contrast #2 was simultaneously overly stretched to fit the longer length of the Giant-Size issue and overly abrupt in getting to its main story of an android rebellion [5/10]. \\n Early Days (1-4). Four issues with three authors doesn't bode well, but the first three actually read quite well. Tony Isabella continues plots from the cancelled Sub-Mariner comic, then Jim Shooter finishes it off nicely. There are some good moments of pathos and shock that both draw us toward and away from our villains [6+/10]. Unfortunately Bill Mantlo caps things with a fourth issue where Doc Doom and Namor decide to fight and break up. Again. There's something about Deathlok that makes little sense without context, and overall the issue is a bore [3/10]. \\n Steve Englehart (5-8). Englehart really changes the feel of this comic. Before it was what it's name promised: a super-villain teamup. As such, it was a very unique book. Here, the Fantasy Four tread heavily in the pages, and the book falls into the more comfortable hero-villain dynamic of most of Marvel's comics. Still, there are some nice elements, particularly the intro of the Shroud (at least, he's nice if he's intended to be hilarious camp, and I think he is). Meanwhile, Englehart returns to classic elements of Hydro Base and the Hydro people, and it's nice to see those plots advance [6/10]. \\n The Avengers (9 + A154-156). Another four issues with three authors: Gerry Conway, Jim Shooter, and the new SVTU author, Bill Mantlo. Clearly, this continues the superheroification of SVTU, but it's not a bad story, as the Avengers stumble into a conflict between Doc Doom, Subby, and Atuma that none of them understand ... which is sort of delightful. The last issue by Shooter is weaker than the Conway or Mantlo issues and focuses on lots of punching, but there's fun deviousness before that [6/10]. \\n The Red Skull (10-12). Bill Mantlo's first solo work on SVTU is ... unfortunately not very inspiring. It's great to have a new villain, as the Doom + Subby dynamic was getting dull. But this story is a pretty dull fight with Cap, Doom, and Shroud facing off against the Red Skull. I think the boringness of Mantlo's Skull really says it all: he's not able to take advantage of the interesting characterization introduced in Englehart's short reign [4/10]. \\n Finale! (13). The final team-up between Doom & Sub-Mariner is nice mainly because it ties up plot threads going back years. The story itself is largely pedestrian fighting [6/10]. \\n Magneto (14 + Champions). Sadly, these issues show how SVTU really lost its way. They're all about Magneto facing off against Doom in a totally normal hero-versus-villain way, and they also inundate the comic with yet more heroes like the Avengers and Champions. Worse, it's a pretty meh story after all that [3/10]. \\n Nazis (16-17). These last issues by Peter Gillis tend to recover what SVTU lost. They're about villains interacting with villains and living in their own ecosystem. It's great to see a truly repugnant Red Skull and the unveiling of the Hate Monger. There are times when the storytelling is clumsy and the pacing feels off, but I'll forgive that for the unusual sort of story that Gillis was telling [7/10]. \\n Overall, Super-Villain Team-Up never fulfilled its promise. There were times when it stood out as something truly unique, but then the Avengers or the Champions or the Fantastic Four blundered in and turned it back into a much more traditional title. In addition, the revolving door of creative teams constantly muddled the plots, often moving major plotlines off to the periphery for no good reason. The loss of the Shroud + Doom plotline mid-book is the most obvious, but it was an ongoing problem. \\n This collection was interesting to read as a piece of historical ephemera, but it probably won't remain in my library.\"),\n",

Michael Straczynski\\'s \"The Twelve,\" Wagner\\'s \"Green Hornet,\" and now \"Masks,\" I get positively giddy. \\n The set-up here for this great team up seems, at first glance, pretty boiler plate. Green Hornet and Kato roll into New York hunting down a gangster. When they encounter the Shadow, he tells them that the newly elected Justice Party though claiming to clean up NYC, isn\\'t what it seems. In short order, we learn that the Justice Party\\'s goals are fascistic - an interesting and excellent incorporation of Pulp era issues. More and more masked heroes join the fight, many with their own plot threads/. These varied threads combine well with an interesting philosophical subplot about the time-worn conflict between law and justice. As with any team-up book, \"Masks\" rises or falls on the writer\\'s ability to individualize characters and give energy to their relationships. Chris Roberson manages to use this philosophical conflict to pour heat into the characters\\' interactions and root each perspective in the larger story. \\n Many of the classic pulp heroes were thin on back story and motivation, but Roberson does a fine job with his cast. Yes, some are \"B\" and even \"C\" list (how many readers have really yearned to see the Green Lama to reappear?), but it is a great cast nonetheless. The Black Terror. The Spider. Miss Fury. There was even one character I was totally unfamiliar with (The Black Bat, a sort of godfather to Daredevil). Even Doc Savage (who Dynamite must not have been able to secure the rights to use), gets a delightful oblique reference. I thought I knew a good deal about the pulps but I\\'m pleased to say Chris Roberson puts me to shame. \\n Of course Alex Ross\\'s cover art, with all its great painted color and willowy lines, adds depth to the whole book. Much of the page art is similarly excellent. When The Green Hornet, Kato, and the Shadow leap off a building into the fray, the former two are upright with fists raised for battle, while the Shadow goes head first, guns drawn, and almost flies out off the page. It is just one of many panels (not to mention the lovely covers), which will make you pause in your read to try and just inhale the depth of action. \\n On a last note, I\\'m not usually a huge fan of the \"bonus material\" featured in trades, coming to books mostly for the story. \"Masks\" was the exception. The early pencil drafts of the illustrations tell you a lot about the source of this art\\'s wonderful sense of movement. Moreover, I enjoyed the range of \"bonus covers\" by a huge variety of artists of diverse styles, which ranged from the ridiculous to the risque. \\n As I said from the beginning, it is hard to imagine a book more tailored for my taste than \"Masks.\" Still, even if you\\'re just an occasional fan of the pulps, if you just have certain weakness for the Shadow or Hornet or (there must be at least one out there) the Buddhist hero, the Green Lama, story, art, and crackling energy combine here into a book well worth your time.'),\n",

Moon Knight's first solo outing is shockingly bad, even though it's also by author Doug Moench. Sure, we learn about MK's multiple identities, which would later form the crux of the character, and the political-oriented plot is kind of nice.

I've always been fond of the un-team and the third-stringers that filled it. Gerber's stories were among the best, but Kraft and Warner aren't bad here (though Kraft is wordier than I'd like). This is a fun tale with a great villain in Scorpio -- who is interesting for both his relation to the rest of the Zodiac and to Nick Fury.

He could be just about any caped crusader for all the personal attention he gets in this story [6/10]. \\n Spider-Man (Mantlo). An interesting crossover with Spider-Man, except Moon Knight really plays second fiddle to Spider-Man's continuing subplots. The coolest thing is that Moon Knight is described as being on a hunt for vengeance against the Maggia ... but as an occasional guest character, he doesn't get to do anything useful with the plot; it's really something that's running through the Spider-Man comics at the time, so it's sort of bizarre to act as if Moon Knight is their big arch-nemesis.

Finally (3 years after his intro), Moon Knight gets his own title, as the backup in the Hulk magazine, and it's pretty good. We get a detective/adventure story, we get good use of all of Moon Knight's identities, and we get the first hints that there might be a little crazy there. Oh, and once the regular art team settles in with issue #13, we get great art: one part good drawing by Sienkiwicz and one part superb coloring by Oliff [7/10]. \\n Hulk 15: Eclipse (Moench). An amusing crossover with the Hulk, but there's no depth here [6/10]. \\n Hulk 17-18, 20: Nights Born Ten Years Gone (Moench). This is terrific noir with a deep insight into the psyche of a criminal and a brutal, personal story that impacts the lives of both Moon Knight and Marlene. Well done, with beautiful art [8/10]. \\n Marvel Preview (Moench)>. Another nice piece of noir & spy craft with more great art by Sienkiwicz. Moench really excels in the double-length story, and one of its greatest joys is Marlene emerging as a terrific fighter all her own [7/10]. \\n Moon Knight (Moench). And at last, we move in to the actual Moon Knight title. It's good to see the Knight in his finalized form, with a new origin (and an explanation for the old one) and more emphasis than ever on his multiple identities. This stories are just a little mundane. I'd like a little more continuity now that Moon Knight has its own title, but they're still well-written and interesting [6+/10]. \\n Overall, Moon Knight Epic Collection 1 is certainly uneven, but it's a great insight into where the character came from, something that you couldn't possibly have read before the release of this Epic volume, showing off the possibilities of the new line.\"),\n",

This is how the story starts and for the next 17 chapters you\\'ll have to explore how both Chiyuki and Touya fall in love, have to over different problems and if Touya will change Chiyuki into one of his kind. \\n I really loved Touya\\'s character. In the beginning he seems a bit apathetic, he\\' stubborn, but as the story progresses I found more and more attracted to his character. He doesn\\'t talk like a 17-yes-old, his decision not to take life-long partner is well thought and his words: \"I don\\'t know what will happen to me in the future, how can I give that life to someone else\" made me gasp. However, his so-called confession was just fantastic. I have a poster of this on my wall. And I really need to make that top confessions list. But this is for later. I remember in the very beginning I didn\\'t really like Chiyuki all that much. I did sympathize with her on her dying soon, however, I though she was very self-centered when she asked Touya to turn her. However, the more the story progresses the more I liked her. I didn\\'t really get it when she actually fell in love with Touya, but she made a fantastic character and the last chapter shows her true feelings. \\n As I have already said I have read the story twice and eve though I knew how it ends, for the last 2 chapter I\\'ve been crying like a small child. I\\'m not all that motional in real life, but if it concerns a really good, well though drama story I can cry my eyes out. The last chapter can be imagined as a bomb of raw feelings. You just can\\'t not shed a tear when seeing Chiyuki on the floor clutching the watch... oops, I might have spoiled something. Sorry, ut I do recommend you to read this story! You\\'ll love it.

       "  'I\\'ve not been the biggest fan of Mark Millar\\'s Ultimates. My boyhood favourite, Captain America, became an unrecognizable bully with questionable ethics; S.H.I.E.L.D. and Nick Fury turned into ultra-violent goon boys for Homeland Security; the Hulk cover-up betrayed most of what I knew about the individuals who made up the group formerly known as the Avengers; the political criticism that I loved as a kid -- the Marvel Universe that helped to shape who I am -- seemed gone, never to return. It was all starting to feel like Glenn Beck had usurped Stan Lee\\'s throne and was writing the Ultimates for Trig Palin in a particularly nationalistic mood. \\n Three volumes later, though, and I finally see that Mark Millar\\'s just been taking his time, building the story with care and attention and intention. This series doesn\\'t adhere to the usual 4-6 issue story arcs. All three volumes (those I\\'ve read so far), encompassing the first nineteen issues, make up one giant story arc. \\n And there are finally some elements I love. \\n Thor, my son\\'s new favourite super-hero, is about the coolest cat in the Ultimates. I love his \"hippy\" politics. I love the way Loki has messed with him so badly that even he doesn\\'t know if he\\'s a god or just some insane Swede. The incestuous flirtations of Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch are a nice peripheral dalliance to tear the tone away from the building of an army full of Persons of Mass Destruction. The necessary escape of Bruce Banner/The Hulk made fun use of Hannibal Lecter -- from foreshadowing to denouement. And the decay of Hank Pym\\'s confidence, his burgeoning hatred, the slow engendering of a super-villain, is a beautiful bit of writing. Now that is more like it! \\n But I\\'m still not fully sold. Unless Steve Rogers is the big turncoat, the one leaking all the dirt on the Ultimates to the press and causing all the problems (which I can\\'t see, but don\\'t tell me if you know. I want to find out for myself), Captain America won\\'t achieve redemption, and I won\\'t be able to forgive Millar. And I remain, moreover, unclear as to what Millar is trying to say. There is every chance that his message will be in diametric opposition to my beliefs, and that will make me terribly sad. \\n If things don\\'t go my way, it doesn\\'t mean I won\\'t continue to enjoy the series. It does mean, though, that I won\\'t be able to love it, and I may very well like it while hating it. I\\'ll just have to press on and see.'),\n",

       "  \"An interesting historical graphic novel about the western expansion of European settlers into Apache territory. This is taken from the point of view of the Apache tribes, which makes it different from every regular Western. It shows the atrocities done to the Apaches and their people and why they attacked back. Of course a lot of other stories just show them being savage and attacking, but this gave reason to that savagery. They were definitely savage in their attacks (filling a church with people, boarding it up and setting it ablaze is one fine example) but the white soldiers were equally savage. There is one particular scene where one Apache leader goes to meet a general for peace negotiations. He is taken under the care of the soldiers but then attacked in the night, killed practically for sport, then his head was stewed in a pot. \\n The Apaches refused to give up their holy land to go to the land prison that was reservations and fought hard for it. One quote in the end of the book though was very telling. For every Apache killed, 10 white men were killed, but for every white man killed they were replaced by hundreds, and every Apache killed was not replaced at all. Very disheartening and a troubling time in our history as a nation. Not to say there weren't detractors. This isn't a book to make the settlers and soldiers into devils, as I think it was mostly fair. There were definitely many soldiers that just wanted to wipe out the tribes like rats, but there were also individuals that wanted peace. While President Grant may have been misguided, he at least did not allow for the slaughter that could have happened. Most of the lower individuals calling for peace were just outranked and outnumbered. \\n Good story, though not the best flow. I think this book really could have been twice as long or more. The writing was decent, though it wasn't always real clear. The artwork was really fantastic. Brush strokes of shades of black, which really showed great character on faces and made beautiful landscapes. I loved how distances faded away as if in a fog. Not every panel was superb (occasionally characters looked stiff) but for the most part it was quite nicely done. Paneling and angles were like a storyboard for a movie (Ethan Hawke's original intention). \\n I would like to get this book for my personal library.\"),\n",

His quest is to go back to his own time, defeat the demon wizard Aku, and thus prevent the terrible future he has witnessed. \\n In this volume, which comprises 5 issues, Jack starts searching for the Threads of Time, which are the shreds of the Ropes of Eons, used by the gods to mark the passage of time when the universe was formed, and torn by the demon wizard Aku once he mastered the sorcery of time travel. \\n If Jack can find a single strand of the Threads of Time, it'll lead him to the others and then send him back to his own time. \\n Will Jack finally be able to defeat the demon wizard Aku? \\n I really enjoyed the premise, it's original and the writing captures the tone of the show, right down to its most humorous aspects. \\n The artwork was pretty good, faithful to the show's distinctive style, especially when it came to action scenes. \\n As always, my only complaint is to do with IDW Publishing's poor quality of the ARC, but since the lettering and artwork in this volume were quite bold, it wasn't as difficult to read as previous ARCs from that publisher. \\n A must read for all fans of Samurai Jack who, like me, were left hanging when the show was cancelled!\"),\n",

       "  \"The Fallen (273-276). The plot of this is just a battle against a proto-blob thingy. But it's got terrific connections to Doctor Who: The Movie, making it a critically important 8th Doctor story. We get to see what happened to Grace later on (in the comic-universe at least) and that proto-blob even devolves from the movie plot. As for the longer term plot ... well that's a topic for another story. [7/10]. \\n Throwback (Kroton: 5-7). A neat introduction to the cyberman Kroton. This close attention to the villains of Doctor Who in the early days of the magazine was quite neat [6/10]. \\n Ship of Fools (Kroton: 23-24). The return of Kroton is less spectacular because it's a one-note story of the sort that was more common in 2000 AD [5/10]. \\n Unnatural Born Heroes (Kroton: 277). And a few decades later, here's Kroton headlining the main DWM strip. It's kind of cool seeing him fight Sontarans and hearing his monologue, but otherwise there's not much going on [5+/10]. \\n The Road to Hell (278-282). Back to the main story ... \\n When Scott Gray was brought on as the regular comic writer, he was asked to write dumbed down standalone stories. Fortunately, he mainly avoided that, but when he didn't, we get a lackluster story like this one. Some alien nanite thing that we don't care about attacks some people that we don't care about and the Doctor gets involved. Yawn. \\n Still, this story had two things going for it. First, the setting of 17th century Japan is quite unique. Second, the character of Katsura gets a rather interesting ending, reminiscent of the storyline for a character in the 12th Doctor's run. I was looking forward too seeing more of him in better future stories, which is exactly what happened [5/10]. \\n A Company of Thieves (283-285). This story has better depth thanks to its many characters with different motives, and also due to a bit of humor. But the real joy is the introduction of Kroton to the TARDIS crew. Yay! Cyberman aboard! [7/10]. \\n The Glorious Dead (287-296). Yowza, a 10-part DWM comic! It's like the DWM Masterplan. And Gray does quite a good job with the story. It's got multiple companions, it's got huge scope. It warps history and goes out into the omniverse. It brings back not one but two interesting villains, and put them to good use. It had twists and turns. Two of the issues drag a little bit (#5 and #9, the two issues with extensive focus on the omniverse), but otherwise this is one of DWM's best longer arcs [8/10]. \\n The Autonomy Bug (297-299). A very cute story of Lost Robots. I think the connections to One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest are understated, meaning that this story mainly comes off as fun cuteness [7+/10]. \\n Again, this volume puts some less canon stories at the end. \\n Happy Deathday! (272) Gray does a rather impressive job of mixing together all the Doctors in a genuinely funny one-off [7/10]. \\n TV Action (283). Another humorous anniversary story, but this one's barely comprehensible [4/10]. \\n The Glorious Dead has some strong stories, particularly the eponymous Glorious Dead and the use of the cyberman Kroton. I'm a bit sad that it doesn't have the cool connection to old DWM stories that the previous volume did, but it sets up plenty of new canon of its own. \\n The biggest weakness of the volume is the characters of Izzy and the Doctor. They're almost entirely flat. I couldn't tell you who either one is; they're just a generic Doctor and a generic companion.\"),\n",

This book has a lot of potential, but I just feel like it would have been a lot better in novel format. This is Sanderson\\'s first foray into graphic novels and you can tell. Sanderson is one of my favorite authors, but this was a bit of a miss. There just seems to be a lot missing between panels, like it moves faster than it ought to. They tried cramming more into it in a shorter time than would have been preferable. I don\\'t mind not always knowing the dialect or politics or culture or other things that are going on in a story, but that\\'s a little different matter than what was missing here. For instance, in one big fight scene toward the end of the book, it was literally handled in 2 panels and it wasn\\'t even clear what happened. \\n It has great world building, which I think has always been a strong suit to Sanderson. The dayside vs darkside stuff was interesting, though barely addressed. The dialogue is okay. The artwork is pretty good, but oftentimes really busy. And the artist has a problem with same face syndrome (when you can make out the face at all), which isn\\'t helped by nearly all daysiders wearing the same uniform, it seems. The panels tried to go for something \"cool\" by never using a square/rectangle panel, but it was just more annoying than anything. There are actually a few instances where there was literally arrows put in the book to tell the reader which way to go. That\\'s a failure if they are needed, if you ask me. \\n I would read the next one and hope for the best, but I\\'m not going to rush out and buy it anytime soon.'),\n",

       "  'This book is about one of the most polemic words I can think of. For some folks (especially teachers of the word), it is hard to think of words that divide folks faster than ... \"math.\" \\n Already a few of you are turning your screens around and clicking on buttons to escape the mere phrase. I\\'m sure a few of you have just now written off this graphic novel as \"unreadable\" or \"too intellectual\" or even \"boring\" for its association with the word. Others have their interest peaked and are ordering copies from Amazon right now. \\n Logicomix: An Epic Search For Truth (though \"epic\" is in the eye of the beholder) concerns itself with a few dead white men (only one non-white man is mentioned, that in the Notes section ... Al Khwarizmi) in their search for a true foundation of mathematics. That is, the proof that the statement 1 + 1 = 2 is true and always true (a statement that our main character wrote a 362 page paper proving to be true). Throughout the narrative, we discover that which makes mathematics come alive for me; the story of the mathematicians behind the abstract thoughts. \\n Inbetween the stories of the people around Bertrand Russell - and the abridged story of Russell - are the ideas that these men debated. This is the era when the absolute truth of mathematics came into question. This is the era when certain numbers were still relegated to the imagination of fools (and the \"imaginary numbers\" retain the name to this day). This is the era when Calculus went from something that \"just worked\" to a branch of mathematics with rigorous definitions. Yes, this was also a time when the world was dealing with the first World War. [Strictly speaking, this book takes place between 1876ish and 1940 with digressions in the present and Ancient Greece] \\n Some of the most interesting stories of the history of math comes out in this period. The development of sets and the discussion of infinity (and how many types of infinity exists). The discussion of logic and whether it came from math or math from it (and also the logic inherent in other aspects of humanity). The book discusses so many huge ideas in the slim 300 pages ... its amazing it holds together so well. \\n The artwork is wonderful. Oftentimes it is structured logically with more or less traditional 9 panel layout, but every so often that layout is destroyed or subverted to create extra movement or a break in the logic being discussed. Nothing new for readers of comics, but very well done. The narrative is wonderfully told, with the ideas being discussed in a simplistic manner - expanded on in the optional appendix - so that everyone can enjoy the history and the ideas discussed. Sure, this is a search in the midst of the abstract. The world being debated existing in the infinite (or even whether infinity exists in the first place ... it\\'s a relatively new concept, folks) space where everything can be rationalized ... or not. \\n Great book. Wonderful history (with some artistic licence here and there) and a great introduction to some of the most interesting aspects of modern mathematics (some of which is taught in high schools today). \\n So put aside your worries about the word, \"math\" and see what the great debate is about. See that the ultimate truthfulness of the subject has been debated from time to time (and may still be). Then enjoy that the basic truths you intuit take 360 pages to prove.'),\n",

This alternate-universe story of the end of times may be full of awe with its grandiose artwork worthy of reverence, rivaling Vaughan\\'s Saga and Y: The Last Man. Unfortunately, East of West messes up with one rudimentary element in a what would have been an excellent material: character personality. \\n Critically-acclaimed graphic novel runs like Aaron\\'s Scalped, Gaiman\\'s Sandman and Koike\\'s Lone Wolf and Cub have characters having the most interesting personalities and unique voices. No matter how much you hate or love what they do, you\\'d instantly know that they are acting according to their persona. Now, East of West has all the interesting characters but somehow, Hickman fails to give his characters that required distinctness. For example, badass as he may be, Death doesn\\'t have a unique voice. It felt that Death as the story\\'s protagonist could be replaced by one of the three cringeworthingly lame Horsemen (I hate these guys!). That is the fundamental flaw in East of West: the set pieces and amazing plot paves the writer to create colorful characters but fails to do so. I mean John Freeman I may be very different from the other Chosen, but he is too shallow to be unique at the level of becoming interesting. Crow and Wolf are two more badasses in the story but they could have been replaced by two equally badass characters.

Well, if you have read my reviews you might be familiar with me not liking the mangas where there are either singers or artists, due to not always imagining colors or sounds come out of the paper. The exceptions are Chiba Kozue and Fukuyama Ryoko's works. However, here in the beginning I was not really feeling the characters singing, not it was still amazing, but there was no sound coming out. Now, when I read either 40th or 41st chapter, I felt it, the sound of their voices reached me. And it was breathtaking. Maybe it was the situation too, but nevertheless it was amazing. \\n Manga may be starting both slow and fast. I am not making any sense, am I? Well, how do I explain it, there are only 50 chapters out or so, however the manga is only starting but it already had a lot in it.

       "  'Marvel is not as exercised in the graphic novel as is DC, but they managed to make a memorable and significant one at that with \"Civil War.\" While Super Hero vs. Super Hero is nothing terribly new, Mark Millar creates a scenario in which it not only makes sense, but is essential to the development of the story. It was pretty terrific seeing an almost complete array of Marvel characters as well (though I did miss seeing quite a few). We see favorites battling favorites, and the real context of this Super Hero war comes into perspective. \\n I did have a few problems with it. The concept is terrific, and is well explored. I just wish that this graphic novel took time to develop the story and characters more. Cramming all these heroes into a mere 200 or so pages leaves little room for any to stay terribly long, and this \"war\" seems to become a little rushed, with just two battles. Additionally, it becomes pretty clear what side you should be rooting for in this story. Yet the end left me feeling extremely ambivalent. It felt like a let down and a small triumph at the same time. It had great significance but also left little truly resolved in a satisfying way. While I felt like I had a balanced perspective at the conclusion of both sides, it was too late. I already knew who to root for, and being unsure and torn from the beginning would have made for a far more captivating experience. \\n This could have been a 5 star masterpiece. It tries to incorporate the complexity and moral ambiguity of \"Watchmen\" with the basic story of \"The Dark Knight Return\" (substituting Batman and Superman with Captain America and Iron Man). It is a sight to see, that\\'s for sure. However, it never amounts to the marvelous execution and development of those two. It is pretty good, just not exceptional.'),\n",

       "  \"see full review @ Katie's Corner \\n It's been quite a long time since I read Mi-Ri Hwang's manhwa. Last one was A tackle on my life back in January. But this one held my interest for a whole day, and I even missed going to the post office just to read it to the end and find out how it all ended. First of all, this is a historical romance, which I started by pure chance (at the time I was more engrossed in books). Truth be told I was still coming down from reading Red River twice, that's why my manga choice was to read a historical one, and I still have some on my reading list. \\n But let me get back to the story. I really loved and enjoyed it. It was fun, with lots of action and many kissing scenes. And I guess because I took quite a long time off from reading Mi-Ri Hwang's books none of the characters felt the same and I could even remember most of their names. Plus it was a miracle that I didn't confuse anyone! Yes, it really is something to celebrate! Let me tell you the plot briefly and then I will move on some other stuff. The plot is quite simple: Shin Bia is a normal high schooler, well normal if we count that she can defeat every gangster in the high school, one day she crosses paths with a rich kid and somehow ends up jumping out of the window. Yup, she is crazy, but instead of dying she ends up in an alternate world, where she has to take the place of her alternate self (long story about the alternative Bia, so better read the story) and become the empress of Ju empire. Interesting? You don't say, as the more you get to know our characters the more fascinating the story becomes! \\n So, let's meet our characters: Shin Bia - aka the Celestial Bia aka the crazy girl aka the glutton aka the impostor. She was a character that I wholeheartedly enjoyed. I loved her spunk and sometimes her unreasonable behaviour, but I really loved watching how she was falling in love with Yoo Baek (that's the crown prince) and then feeling awful, as she knew he loved the real Celestal Bia and not her. Are you ready to follow her on the journey in an alternate world and be present when she embarrasses herself or does something out of this world? But before I let you go to read this awesome story let us meet our male protagonist - Yoo Baek - aka the crown prince aka the tyrant aka the perverted demon. I really love the last title as he went by it in the beginning of the story. He's a really likable character and you just love how those two are together. He was a bit disappointing when he finds out that Bia is not his real Bia, but his confession made my heart flutter like crazy! \\n There are many more interesting characters, but I won't be talking about them. Another thing that I really loved about this story was the ending. It actually has one, though I would have loved to see a bit more, it was still very satisfying. Are you ready for 19 volumes of fun, adventure, action and tons of romance? I sure hope you are! Enjoy it to its fullest and don't forget to share your thoughts below!

       "  'An intriguing book. In some ways more enjoyable than the movie, and in other ways ... well, the movie did some things better. As a graphic novel, sure, it has some interesting bits. The drawing style and text at times get so crowded my head hurts and I have to go over bits again and again. It doesn\\'t help that so often there are two or three speakers carrying on two different conversations over the course of the panels either. \\n That is, of course, a minor complaint. One that most graphic novel readers would easily overcome, though I do see it as a hindrance to the flow of the story. I mean, sure, there are lots of interesting bits in here. A great exploration of the anti-hero (in many ways, the book creates V as a much less likable character) and the reasonings of a mad man (something Alan Moore also explored in The Watchmen). The differences between anarchy and chaos matched with the subtleties of totalitarian states (much scarier and more realistic than the 1984 version of the same). \\n Still, in the end, I wasn\\'t impressed. It was good, no doubt, but did not wow me in any special way. It didn\\'t strike me as a fantastic homage (which is, according to the article reprinted in this edition, what it started as) nor as anything strikingly original though it tries to be. Maybe I was bored with deciphering the dialect of the slumlord character. Maybe I wanted a sympathetic face (who wasn\\'t also pathetic) hiding in the next panel. Maybe it was the mere fact that no one is innocent in this novel that makes it hard for me to enjoy it as much as I did other books. \\n Maybe it was the forced cleverness of the whole thing. Naming each chapter with a word that starts with \"v\" gets old quickly and forcing that type of theme onto everything just is sad. Maybe it was the infatuation the writer and artist had with V and the need to use him and the dominoes everywhere. \\n Maybe it was too British (though if it was, it hit me at a subconscious level). \\n Still, there are good things here too. It entertained me for the time I read it and I did enjoy it. The aftertaste is just not my style.'),\n",

       "  \"I wasn't totally sure what I should expect for a comic based on a game that is basically about fighting and dying big monsters. I've played a little of Dark Souls 2 and I have read there is a lot of good lore, but it can be confusing and not entirely cohesive. Visually though, the game is pretty badass. \\n The first thing I noticed was the writing used thee and thou frequently. I don't think that is really used in the game, but I might be mistaken. I asked a friend that has played all of them and he didn't remember that being in there either. Honestly, I really could have done without the fake olde englifhe. Beyond that though, the writing was really just kind of mediocre. It was generally a disappointment, though I can't say it was particularly bad. I think at times it tried to be better, or more poetic, than it really was. The story did get at least some things from the games as far as the death of the world in darkness and the cycle and the hollow ones, etc. It revolved around one woman knight that was trying to save the world by gathering some relics and reviving a dragon, then killing it again, though she chooses not to deliver the final blow and save the pain and suffering of future generations (because, presumably they won't exist if she doesn't save them now), and breaks the cycle. \\n The artwork was also okay. It was rather colorful for Dark Souls, which is kind of dark and blue tinted (for the most part anyway). Apart from that the colors were pretty nicely done, but the illustrations themselves were a bit amateurish. Proportions were off, poses were stiff, faces weren't always consistent, etc. Sometimes panels changed too much too frequently, presumably to add visual interest, but you still need a base. So, much like the writing, it wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either. \\n I don't regret reading it, but I wouldn't read it again.

How does one make him relevent when he\\'s always been the easy target of pop culture jokes (and his Marvel equivalent is decidely more bad ass)? \\n If you are Geoff Johns you address the issue head on, out in the open, morphing it from a negative into a positive, challenging the reader to set aside their biases, feel some shame for their \"uninformed opinions\" and empathize with Aquaman. \\n It works a treat. One issue is all it takes to get hooked by Aquaman, and I figure Geoff Johns will be reeling me in by the end of the arc.Aquaman #2 --Cheesy puns aside for this issue, I promise. \\n What we have here is a classic Aquaplot. Crazy sea creatures, in this case fish-like humanoids with giant pointy teeth -- sort neo-uber-gila men -- have attacked a fishing trawler, then a town, so Aquaman is called in to have a look. \\n Turns out Aquaman\\'s not too popular with law enforcement, and they certainly don\\'t take him seriously, but none of that matters when the neo-uber-gila men are attacking at full force, spitting paralytic goo and generally giving Aquaman and Mera a tough battle on the docks of the wee beseiged town. \\n If you like big, nearly bloody battles you\\'ll dig this issue. I\\'m not a huge fan of these sorts of battles, but it\\'s fun to see Aquaman in action. So there\\'s that.Aquaman #3 --The neo-uber-gila men run into too much resistance and retreat into the sea, bearing humans in goo-pods as future food, but they leave behind one of their kind, which gives Arthur / Aquaman a reason to fill Mera and us in on his background, and how his youth fits in with deluded and slightly evil Marine Biologist Stephen Shin. \\n Not much happens in this issue, except that Dr. Shin helps Aquaman determine the origin of the new-uber-gila men, which is good enough for Arthur. He and Mera take off for the Trench, antagonizing Shin in the process and setting up, no doubt, some future trouble for themselves. \\n A slower pace in this issue would have helped, but I know this isn\\'t going to happen. It\\'s not in Johns writerly-DNA.Aquaman #4Aquaman and Mera track the new-uber-gila men to their lair with a hive-Queen at the center. Mera wants to kill them and do away with their \"evil,\" but Arthur wants to protect their species and to understand them if he can. The conflict between their approaches is interesting, but there\\'s little debate -- almost no debate. Aquaman presses on, not killing the new-uber-gila men in the process, and Mera follows unhappily. \\n Then Aquaman kills them all anyway (or so it seems) because steals (liberates?) their food, and when they try to take it back to fee their starving children, Aquaman unleashes the violence he\\'d been holding back in the form of an ocean floor volcano, thus burying them under rock and lava. Yep, twelve humans from a small coastal town are more important than an entire species. Glad we have that sorted out.Aquaman #5The first ten panels, which include a two page spread, are ten of the best panels I\\'ve seen. Arthur falls from the sky, and climbing out of the crater he left in the desert, he looks around and whispers, \"Uh-oh.\" It looks gorgeous and it is scripted with sparing beauty. The rest of the issue fails to match this brilliance, however, and disappointment in this arc is truly beginning to settle in for me.Aquaman #6Before the next arc begins, before we figure out \"Who sank Atlantis?\" (the big question surrounding what\\'s to come), we get an interesting little interlude with Mera (a.k.a. Aquawoman, but don\\'t call her that). We see her Atlantean ethics at odds with supposedly human ethics (which are always a little too benevolent in the DC universe beyond Gotham), we discover the breadth of her powers, and she makes a friend. I like her. I wonder if I will like Arthur as much as I like her the next trade around. Doubt it.'),\n",

       "  'Another collection of Claremont\\'s X-Men at its best. The Dark Phoenix Saga, Days of Future Past, Demon, and the later Magneto and Hellfire tales are all quite good, and still being mined by authors today. \\n The Dark Phoenix Saga (132-137) that leads things off is really Claremont & Byrne at their best. The first issues with the Hellfire Club presents some great new villains every bit as interesting as Magneto and his Brotherhood a decade and a half before, but it\\'s really the shocking changes in Jean that result and her ultimate fate that make this an unprecedented blockbuster. I also love the decision to bring Angel & Beast back for this pivotal story [10/10]. \\n Shorts (138-144, Annual 4). It\\'s amazing how many short stories appear in this book, really depicting a different era of comic writing. Most would agree that \"Days of Future Past\" (141-142) is the highlight here, and if it\\'s faded a bit from age, it\\'s only because it\\'s been so frequently revisited, and so the core imagination of the idea is no longer apparent. However, my favorite is \"Demon\" (143) which is the story that really turns Kitty into a hero. I also enjoy the big recap issue (138); it was the comic that revealed to me the mythology of the X-Men, back in the early \\'80s. The rest of the stories run the gamut from weak (Annual, D\\'Spayre) to OK (Alpha Flight) [7+/10]. \\n Doom & Arcade (145-147). This was the first extended X-Men arc that I ever read, so it\\'s no surprise that it\\'s still among my favorites. Still, it\\'s a great arc. The X-Men enter the wider world through a confrontation with Doom; Claremont expands the cast by bringing in four old members, showing the future potential for a franchise (though most of them afterward disappear without any explanation); and every character gets the chance to shine through the individual death traps. Storm\\'s role may be the coolest, because we see her potential to be a ... goddess [7+/10]. \\n Avengers Annual #10. I\\'ve been wanting to read this intro to Rogue for decades, but honestly it was a little disappointing. The whole story runs too long, which makes the battles with the Brotherhood drag. Sadly, Rogue doesn\\'t get a lot of attention and to my surprise the whole battle with Ms. Marvel took place off screen. The best part of the story is the coda, which resolves an old Ms. Marvel / Avengers plotline, but that\\'s always where Claremont was at his best in this era: when dealing with characters [6+/10]. \\n Magneto (148-150). Another story that might be extra beloved by me because it was one of my earliest X-Men reads. Still, this is good stuff, with Claremont deftly weaving together a growing Magneto menace with the X-Men\\'s other tales. The introduction of Caliban (148) is good mainly for what it sets up in the future. The invasion of Magneto\\'s old base (149) is very eerie and also does a great job of reminding us of the comic\\'s history. Finally, the conclusion (150) is a terrific story, mainly for how it ends -- and for how it\\'ll change Magneto\\'s character in years to come [8/10]. \\n Annual #5. I\\'ve never loved this story, and apparently some thing never change. It\\'s just such an off-kilter story with Arkon vs. the Badoon; when I read it in the \\'80s I had no idea who all this people were, but even today it feels unimportant to the X-Men\\'s overall arc. Besides that, it\\'s slow (a frequent problem with annuals from the era) and is mainly just a big fight against he Badoon. Seeing the X-Men and the FF work together was the whole special bit, and though that was amazing in the \\'80s, it\\'s not in the modern, interconnected Marvel universe [5/10]. \\n Marvel Fanfare. I would have expected these to be super-star issues, since they were stories for a high-quality Marvel magazine. Instead they\\'re mediocre. The first two issues, which appear to be two issues of Marvel Team-Up (Spider-Man and Angel + Spider-Man and Ka-Zar) are the worst, but even when Claremont brings the whole team in for issues #3 & #4, things just improve slightly thanks to the team dynamics. I loved seeing the Savage Land and the Mutates, many of who would return for much better roles late in Claremont\\'s run, but this story has no depth [5/10]. \\n Fortunately, things improve when we return to the main comic proper ... \\n Hellfire Gambit (151-152). Another great story, mainly for its focus and expansion of the Hellfire Club. Emma Frost and Ororo both get great screen time here, and the Hellfire Club continues to be a fearsome adversary. You can also see the seeds of the Hellions-based academy stories that would run through the New Mutants and later Generation X [8/10]. \\n Kitty\\'s Fairie Tale (153). I loved this more when I was younger, but it\\'s still an innovative and fun story. Again, you can also see foreshadowing of everything from Lockheed the Dragon to the Bamfs, making it another idea-filled story [7/10]. \\n Shorts. The solo stories that finish the book aren\\'t that notable. In fact, the Wolverine and Angel stories are quite bad -- shallow and cliched. It\\'s only the Bizarre Adventures stories that raise the bar back up a bit, mostly thanks to the in-depth look at all of the characters, plus the funny in the Nightcrawler story. Still, as a whole: [5/10].'),\n",

       "  \"Saitama, aka the One-Punch man literary beats his opponents with just one punch! This is how strong our hero is. Already laid-back even before he became the world's strongest hero, eventually he got too bored because no monster has ever posed a real threat to him. Saitama has all the strength of Fist of the North Star's Kenshiro who is always nonchalant like Naruto's Shikamaru. \\n Plus, he's bald. \\n One thing very noticeable with One-punch man is that it does away with lengthy back stories and complicated plots. Rather, the manga throws you right away with outrageously boombastic fight scenes from almost cover to cover. No shitty dialogues and corny lines, just pure martial fun. \\n I may have outgrown this type of manga (or may have read too much Kazuo Koike creations), but One-Punch man is downright funny and entertaining. The dullest moments I've read are Saitama's backstories prior to him going bald but those scenes are way more than just being mediocre. \\n The monster designs in one-punch man are detailed, regardless of how long their screen time is. I find it so hilarious when most of them have very serious motivations to invade earth, only to be thwarted by a seemingly uninspired protagonist. With this regard, I must honorably mention Vaccine Man! \\n One-Punch may not be anymore suited for my age but one cannot ignore how good it is. Looking forward to reading the second volume.\"),\n",

       "  \"(A Warning To Parents: This book is a serious introduction to Manga and includes a few references to and examples of graphic sexual and violent works. It is almost certainly not suitable for children under the age of 15) \\n I cannot recommend this book highly enough and on many levels. It explains Manga in almost every conceivable way that might be of interest - its context in Japanese cultural and political history, its social role, its development and growth as a business, its sheer scale and its influence overseas. \\n It does this with a profusion of examples to illustrate almost every major stylistic aspect of Manga's development. It is, in short, an essential basic reference text from an expert author totally confident in his subject matter. \\n Most of my reviews on GoodReads take seriously the site's injunction to say something of what I have learned from a text. In this case, I am tempted to skip that part and just refer you to the book itself - by the time that you have finished it, you will have a good grounding in the subject and be able to make some sensible choices and aesthetic judgements of your own. \\n But I cannot resist a few pointers. There is the debt owed by Manga to American comic book art from its inception. The idea that it is a wholly indigenous creation that somehow blossoms late out of pre-Meiji Floating World print-making is just not tenable. It would not exist if General Douglas MacArthur had not turned Japan upside down after its defeat in 1945. Manga is uniquely Japanese but it is also uniquely liberal-capitalist. Its context is the creation of a Japan that was forced to live or die by the market as it tried to preserve the best of its traditional values. \\n The ruthless corporate creation and management of the Manga market is a constant theme of the book. Most Manga writers and draughtsman operate in a high pressure factory environment that is no different from the rest of Japanese corporate culture. There is little of that free and easy spirit of letting the artist wonder off and ponder his navel while the marketing men wait for the fruits of his genius. \\n This is a business with a brutally direct relationship with a demanding public, part of whom is so engaged with this world that it will compete to be the next generation of 'auteurs' under conditions that would break the spirit of most Westerners. The fact is that the whole European comic market is only 10% of the size of the Japanese Manga market and it is brutally competitive. \\n But what of the psychological function of Manga to its readers. Japan is a culture that is both sex-positive and yet concerned to keep its non-Christian world-view operating within bounds that cannot rely on some external force such as God or Kantian flummery. Japan has to appeal to tradition values without encouraging anyone to return to the dark side of Bushido. \\n This leads to some strange ambiguities in regulation and misunderstandings by Westerners who come into contact with it. The explicit sexual and violent content of Manga is vastly exaggerated in the West. The norm is, in fact, a wide range of more or less intense explorations of human interaction and feeling geared to every age range's innermost drives as they move through life. \\n Manga socialises but accepts the human condition for what it is - and this will leave some space for the darker shores of sex and violence at the margins of Manga as at the margins of any society. The Japanese simply have the courage not to pretend the dark side is not present or that it can be wished away by appeal to the pulpit, including the pulpit that has been set up inside most Westerners' heads. \\n Watching Manga's effect on my children, I see the effect as wholly positive. It explores themes and ideas that are difficult to talk about with peers and parents, exploring fears and desires in dreamscapes of considerable sophistication. The Gibli anime series exemplifies the fantasy non-linear side of Japanese culture but the tpical Manga is a tale of people who can be identified with in all their human complexity. Japan may use discipline and ritual to restrain and constrain desire and fear but it does not wish away these feelings and drives or give them negative or positive moral value in themselves. \\n The leitmotif of the Westerner is 'guilt' at failing to meet the standards of some internal policeman whereas the Japanese will feel 'shame' for failing to meet obligations that are social if equally internalised. This difference between guilt and shame is fundamental and Manga plays a major role in allowing an outlet for feelings that must not be denied but only so that they may be evaluated and appropriate action considered. If my children have constructed independently a high moral code of a rather conservative nature (which they seem to have done) then I am sure that I can put this very much down to their reading of Manga from an early age. \\n The closing chapters of the book move from the mass market to the almost anarchic artistic fringe of Manga and then to its export overseas, driven and transformed by market considerations on the back of anime exports to children's television. What is most interesting is that the Japanese business community treats export markets in culture much as it does export markets in consumer durables - as a challenge in which the best of foreign technology is to be stripped down, analysed and imported back into Japan to see if it can be systematised. \\n Westerners, especially the current late teenage generation, have taken to Manga in a big way, in part perhaps because it is unique to their generation, a foreign import that most parents simply cannot understand. Reading Manga is a learned skill, counter-intuitive to a mass popular culture that privileged first the word on the page and then the moving image but was dismissive (until recently) of the comic, now privileged as the 'graphic novel'. \\n Manga is positively Wagnerian without the music. It merges visuals and language in storyboards that are played out in the mind. The Western separation of text, music and image/sound, of book, of music and of film, means that the mind leaps from the pure internalisation of reading and listening to the passive intake of spectacle without finding space for Manga's half-way house of word and image being internalised as a tale that can immediately relate to social concerns and feelings. \\n Manga is at its best when it raises serious questions about what it is to be a boy or girl at such-and-such a time of life. It means that one is neither solipsistically engaged in great literature nor lost in the collective will of the movie or the opera. Kids today like this. Their concerns are social and internal, not just internal OR social - and Manga works for them at this level. \\n Part of this younger generation of Westerners has not only taken Manga to its heart but is beginning to transform it in a direct dialogue with the Japanese publishing houses. What the book brings out is the degree to which, creatively, Japanese-American and Japanese-French ('bandes dessines') influences are creating new themes and new works for the more sophisticated end of the Japanese market, as well as for the American and European markets, alongside the mainstream offers of Tokyo Pop. \\n Bit by bit, other related Japanese cultural phenomenon, such as Cosplay, are likely to merge with Western fandom into new cultural forms. No doubt, the big Japanese brands and digitalisation will give us new Western-style blockbusters that are as showy as the Marvel-inspired productions that now emerge every year. \\n This is globalisation driven by the market, but it is not one that creates some standard universal pap. The complexity and intensity of the Manga community's response to the market is not resentful but fertile - a frenetic creativity that matches the inner core of human fears and desires with a very high level of sensitivity and artistic creation. \\n One can only hope that priests and 'moral guardians' in the West do not get their ignorant, restrictive and grubby paws on this surge of creativity and force it into tramlines that will reduce it to mere brain fodder - as the Hays Code managed to do to the creative glory that was Hollywood from the 1930s to the 1960s and as waves of censors have done in the West since time immemorial. \\n Worse, I fear that the growth of the importance of the 'three faiths' markets for Manga may come to infect Japan itself with Western neurosis. This would be a tragedy for Japan and for the West.\"),\n",

       "  \"An interesting little book about a lonely little android. Very reminiscent to the movie A.I. as the main character is an android that looks just like a 10 year old boy, who has a very strong emotional core programming. Some crazy planet sized robots killed a whole lotta people and now 10 years later robots have been all but wiped out. What few remain are hunted by a crazed group from a particular planet. \\n The interesting aspect has to do with the political parts dealing with multiple planets in a union. The really anti-bot group are outside this union and will do anything to destroy as many as they can. The aliens are mostly interesting but still predominantly bipedal. The notes in the back do mention a gaseous being, but they weren't in this book (that I noticed). There ends up being another group of robot freedom fighters, more or less, and there are hints to more things going on beyond the scope of this volume. As with most single volumes, it generally ends up just making me want more because they aren't long enough to get much going. I am certainly intrigued. Some of the things I didn't care for, primarily the Driller is Killer bot. The design seemed far too blocky and not believable as a real robot (more 50s era B-movie sci-fi - which I DO like, but seemed out of context in this book) and his dialogue was just stupid and unbelievable as a robot. I will say, points to the artist for not giving the female lead high healed shoes. \\n And on that note, this is where this book really shines, is in the art. Every page is clearly hand drawn and hand painted with watercolors. There is certainly variable qualities and details, but that's okay as they are still really nice to look at. I've never actually seen anything done quite like this before, which adds to the appeal. The art alone would make me buy (or at least check out) the next volume. I'll be keeping an eye out.\"),\n",

It was only 10 years later that they were published separately in \"Return to the Chateau\". I just spent all last night and this morning trying to figure it out. It drove me that crazy. Here\\'s why... \\n There\\'s not a page that goes by where someone\\'s not naked or engaging in a sexual act of some sort. It\\'s an erotic novel about a Parisian woman on her journey as a slave. THAT much sex, to me, gets boring. I just don\\'t care after a while. However, with the BDSM dynamic thrown in, there\\'s something larger unfolding that\\'s only hinted at in those last couple of paragraphs that tell you what happens in the suppressed chapters. Something interesting and horrible that saves the book from being shallow pornography. I don\\'t think I\\'ll rate this book without reading the second book, to be honest. It\\'s too important. I don\\'t think I\\'ll be disappointed though. \\n What I did like...so far: BDSM power dynamics is my favorite subject to investigate in human sexuality studies. There are no two stories that are the same. Protocols, levels of submission, who is in control?, who thinks they\\'re in control?...it\\'s fascinating. The Story of O got a lot of backlash from feminists who thought it glorified violence against women. It\\'s just not that simple. Yes, O is debased and beaten, but it\\'s clear that she takes pleasure from it and she is reminded over and over again that she can choose to leave. \"Slave\" is as valid an identity as \"feminist\" and just as much a choice. I think the author anticipated that not everyone would understand this, and that\\'s why we get the character Anne-Marie. It lets readers see that there\\'s not just one dynamic, but many. In this diversity, there is certainly a space where women have an enormous amount of power.'),\n",

Both \"Devil\\'s Garden\" and \"Devil\\'s Cage\" are terrific for their ominous looks at Stacy. However, once you get past the more revealing stories about Hunter and Stacy\\'s youths, the stories get a bit plodding, especially those that just show Grendel doing random criminal stuff [6/10]. \\n Sympathy for the Devil. Huh, a Grendel \"It Gets Better\". Who\\'d have guessed!? Not terribly original in the points it hits though. \\n Red, White & Black. Unfortunately the whole Black, White & Red idea has gotten pretty stale by this point. Most of the stories in here are dull bits of crime. Others reiterate historical points from \"Devil by the Deed\", but they don\\'t add much to those stories. Worse, some go totally artsy-fartsy in an attempt to generate interest. The biggest problem with these historical stories is that they don\\'t really tell us anything new, and so they make it feel like there are no new stories of Hunter Rose. With that all said, there were a couple of stories that I liked in this series before I got thoroughly bored. \"Devil\\'s Week\", with art by Matt Wagner, nicely recalls Devil by The Deed. \"Chase the Devil\" nicely reminds you just how evil Hunter Rose was.

       "  \"This book is the weakest of the bunch so far, in my opinion. It had a lot of stuff happening but none of it really stood out as great. \\n The beginning started with a little backstory on Tulip and Amy. Why she hates guns. I kind of liked this arc, but it almost was too cliched and too brief. \\n After that there is an issue with Custer on the road picking up people that was more or less pointless. Then we have some reunions which were a little too saccharine to be believed. Then Custer goes on a little history search of Cassidy. Miraculously bumping into someone that knew him, at a very opportunistic moment. I did like the history of Cassidy, though. He really can be a monster, as Custer initially said in the first book. \\n The moment when Jesse catches Cassidy's (basically superman) fist was incredibly stupid, even with mention of broken bones. It has never shown that Genesis gave Jesse super human abilities besides the voice, but his fighting skills are just always over blown. He never takes a hit. \\n Which brings us to more history, of when Jesse, Tulip, and Amy did some bad things. More super Jesse to the rescue. I get it, he's the epitome of Texas Man, right. \\n Intermixed is the demise of Arseface, who you just have to feel sorry for. But man, he's a dumbass just like his father said. \\n Also, a little bit with Starr and the Grail. Despite being Allfather, he still has old ghosts to deal with. Most of this stuff was slap stick humor, which seemed kind of stupid. \\n Reading my review, I maybe should have made this book 3 stars. It's almost like Ennis took a break and it was ghost written by someone else. I hope the next, and final, book makes amends.\"),\n",

       "  'see full review @ Katie\\'s Corner \\n Today I\\'m having yet another work by Mayu Shinjo. It\\'s a relatively small story compared to Sensual Phrase only 7 volumes long. However, I\\'ll be doing two reviews on it, so look forward to the next one somewhere next week! Why did I decide to make to reviews? Well, because the story has two events, therefore I want to cover each separately. Today\\'s review will cover Kirara as the idol. \\n So let me begin: meet Kirara Nakazono - an aspiring idol, who as she herself says has no talent but has the enthusiasm to become the first! \\n pic 1 \\n (That actually happens much, much later, but I just wanted to put it here) to gain popularity she takes part in various late night shows as well as some variety ones. However, everything changes when her manager - Hanamaki, throws he inside an apartment with words: \"get your body out there and get a job!\" \\n pic 2 \\n Yes, it does happen! It also doesn\\'t help the situation that Kirara is a virgin. But don\\'t forget this is a romance story; therefore a silver-haired prince (Wolf in disguise) appears to help Kirara! However, his motives are not all that pure and you\\'ll be laughing when you get to read them. Who is this silver-haired prince that stole Kirara\\'s heart in a flash? Meet our man lead - Ginzou Fujiwara or for short Gin - the most influential man in Japan (well, after his dad and grandpa). He takes a strange interest in Kirara and wants to make her his. Will he succeed? And by succeeding I mean to make both Kirara\\'s body and heart completely his. Start reading now and find out, how Fin will be trying to seduce Kirara! \\n Now, you can stop reading if you are afraid of spoilers, as I\\'ll be discussing some issues that are tightly related to spoilers. But if you are interested, please continue! This story as Sensual Phrase is set in the world of Showbiz. However, we get to see how the author actually makes fun of some things. Surely there are serious moments too, like when Kirara conforms Gin in the very beginning about her dream, but the way Gin changes everything on a whim if he doesn\\'t like something is just comical. The best issue is Kirara\\'s virginity and her accused lewdness. I just couldn\\'t stop laughing when Gin is accusing he of being a pervert because her room is small. Her phrase: \"Let me lick you\" just made me fall down from the chair even when I was reading for the third time. I knew that she would say it, but the impact was still too strong. There are numerous jokes about Gin and Kirara, but in the end he still makes her his, that is a problem arises. \\n Gin being Gin is a very selfish and jealous person. As soon as he falls hard for Kirara he becomes a hardcore possessive boyfriend. His stunts and idiotic behavior made me laugh before Kirara was a virgin \\n well actually even after that. But as soon as he gets her, his jealousy was overwhelming. He wanted Kirara only for himself and even told her to leave the entertainment world. Here comes the problem. Kirara wanted to achieve her dream, so they became enemies, and now without Gin how will Kirara manage to climb to the top again? She will and it will be a hard journey especially if Gin is trying to sabotage her. But if you thought that Kirara was a complete idiot in the beginning, you get to see her differently now. She is a strong willed person who wants to achieve her dream and return to the one she loves the most! \\n Are you ready to read Kirara and Gin\\'s story? It\\'s full of love, fantastic humor and lots of misunderstandings that make you laugh. You\\'ll also get to see one of your favourite characters from Sensual Phrase to appear! Don\\'t miss the 2nd review of this fabulous story, as now it\\'s Gin\\'s turn to climb to the top! Enjoy it to its fullest and don\\'t forget to share your thoughts below! Stay tuned for more reviews as well as promos. Don\\'t miss your next favourite book or manga! Happy reading! \\n XOXO \\n Katie'),\n",

       "  \"Earlier this year a three disc set was released celebrating the tour that Neil Gaiman and Amanda Palmer took together. One disc for each person's solo stuff and the third contained collaboration work. Listening to the disc of Neil Gaiman is a great way to tell if you'll be interested in this story. At the very least, it gives you a good sense of what you're in for. \\n Because this is a Neil Gaiman story through and through. Though the tale is woven like a Scottish fairy/morality tale, in the end there is the storyteller; clearly Gaiman. So whether you enjoy this book will come down to if you enjoy Gaiman as a storyteller. Because that is what you are going to get. \\n In this novella - with beautiful illustrations by Eddie Campbell that are intimately connected to the story - you will get the strange distanced voice of the narrator recalling a memory. This is a memory of a strange journey to a Misty Isle. The journey reveals certain truths about our two characters ... neither of which are completely good nor completely evil; though one is painted in harsher tones by the end of the story than the other. This is akin to the voice that held Ocean At the End of the Lane above so many of its horror kin. Being grounded in reality as this one is, though, that fog of memory doesn't work quite as well as it does for Ocean. \\n Still, as you can tell from my rating, I do like Gaiman as a storyteller. I want to seek out the recording he made of this story - with musical accompaniment that was part of the second performance; this story was meant to be read out loud - and follow along with his voice as I make my way through this little novelette again. But is this the place to start reading Gaiman? No. This is a quiet little story, something that may slink into the sea of his work only to be hooked by a random reader from time to time. Nothing to write home about. Nothing to shrink back from. Just Gaiman.\"),\n",

       "  'I was worried about reading the Secret Wars again after all these years. Would my rereading destroy its mystique? Would it turn out to be unqualified crap? Would it hurt my love of Marvel? Would it taint other memories of other comics from the same period? Despite my fears, I was compelled to try it anyway. \\n I had recently repacked my comics, and I\\'d come across my wrapped and cared for originals, and days later I discovered the Marvel app for my iPod. I bought it and the first thing I saw was the Secret Wars. It was fated, so I started reading. \\n The story is pretty weak, much weaker than I remembered. I\\'m not going to cover up its flaws. It is too straightforward to be brilliant. Too deus ex machina to be fully satisfying. And it lacks the metaphysical depths of DC\\'s Crisis on Infinite Earths (their excellent attempt to compete with Marvel\\'s surprising success, or to clean-up the mess that was their continuity -- whichever you prefer to believe). The women in Secret Wars were not treated well. The choice of supervillains was too arbitrary. The battle lines were silly. There is plenty to complain about. \\n But... \\n There are some brilliant moments, and here are my five faves -- the five that make me dig this story even with all its flaws:1. Magneto Fighting with the Heroes: I loved this just as much today as I did the first time I read the story. This was the moment Magneto, always my favourite \"villain\" became my favourite all around character. His \"terrorist\" activities, motivated by a desire to save his mutant brethren, were finally recognized as grey enough in motivation to be almost altruistic, and watching the \"heroes\" have to deal with that revelation was one of the best threads of the series. Much more could have been done with this, but Jim Shooter\\'s decision to do this at all was a Marvel Universe changer. \\n 2. Captain America at His Best: There\\'s this scene where Dr. Doom, now beyond powerful, is kicking the heroes need to take off and save themselves. Captain America gives the order for retreat, then he goes back into their crumbling base and releases all the super-villains from their captivity. He\\'s joined by a surprised and impressed Woverine. That is the Captain America I know in love. The same Captain America who would eventually fight Iron Man in the Civil War and die on the courthouse steps. It\\'s easy to see that Jim Shooter loved Cap as much as I did. \\n 3. Reed & Doom: I never cared much for the Fantastic Four and their nemesis before Secret Wars, but Doom was the perfect egomaniacal choice to challenge the Beyonder\\'s power, and Reed Richard\\'s steady brainiac self was an excellent compliment to Captain America\\'s leadership. \\n 4. Galactus: C\\'mon?! The guy eats worlds. And he had a great moment or two with Reed. What a pleasure to see Galactus dwarfed in power too, and without Silver Surfer around to piss him off. Excellent. \\n 5. The Birth of Venom: If you\\'re a Marvel fan, or even just a Spidey fan, you know what this means. \\'Nuff said.In the end, this journey into the mind of the fourteen year old Brad kicked ass. Secret Wars is as good and as bad as I remember. And I love it (even if I can only give it four stars) just the same. Next up: The Dark Phoenix Saga; X-Men #129-138.'),\n",

The latter is a fresh read after reading Kazuo Koike\\'s trilogy of stories with Goseki Kojima (Lone Wolf and Cub, Samurai Executioner and Path of the Assassin). Lady Snowblood, although its setting is 19th century Japan where the west is slowly establishing its influence. \\n Lady Snowblood is very much like Ogami Itto of the Lone Wolf and Cub, they ate both assassins for hire while seeking for revenge against those who killed their family. But while Itto is a father and a husband, Lady Snow Blood, Yuki (or Oyuki) is a daughter who is \"cursed\" by her dying mother to avenge her family\\'s tragic fate. \\n I don\\'t know which medium (movie or graphic novel version) of Lady Snowblood Quentin Tarantino drew inspiration from in his Kill Bill Vol.1, but you can see elements from the Kill Bill which are similar to what happened in Lady Snowblood, in particular, Kiddo\\'s (Uma Thurman) kill list and O-ren Ishii\\'s (Lucy Liu) tragic childhood. \\n Lady Snowblood should be definitely in your list if you are looking for a classic adult manga.

Okay, maybe not in every as the romance between a teacher and a student, but in how the relationship progressed it was way too shoujo.

       "  \"Award-winning writer Brian Michael Bendis gives us this fun, quirky reboot of the Guardians of the Galaxy series just in time for the release of the new Marvel movie. But unnecessary character additions and inconsistent art make this graphic novel far from perfect. \\n Unbeknownst to its residents, Earth has become the new hot commodity as villains from all over the galaxy fight tooth and nail to get their share. But the Guardians of the Galaxy won't have any of that and declare that the Earth is off-limits. As they battle off invasions, Star Lord, Rocket Raccoon, Gamora, Groot, Drax, and even Iron Man try and figure out why the scum of the universe are all of a sudden looking to Earth like it's an all-you-can-eat buffet. \\n Cosmic Avengers attempts to capitalize on the popularity of the Avengers franchise, made obvious by not only the name but the new addition of Iron Man to the team. Unfortunately this particular volume is used to set up the new narrative for the series, so things are left unresolved and it lacks a complete story arc. Additionally, Iron Man himself adds nothing to either the narrative or the team dynamic, making him just a tag-along sidekick rather than the fan-favourite hero we all know him to be. \\n The art by Steve McNiven is for the most part amazing, but it lacks consistency. Done in a more traditional style with heavy inks, the issue lies in the anatomy. McNiven creates dynamic page layouts, but will oftentimes have one or two panels where the anatomy of the subject is simply off. \\n Overall I enjoyed this read and would recommend it to anyone looking for a series commitment that's a little less serious. \\n via The Other Press \\n http://theotherpress.ca/comic-corner-...\"),\n",

He's in that school of comix artists who write uncomfortable strips about their uncomfortable lives and always make me feel voyeuristically dirty for reading them. These are the kind of people who, if the comics are to be believed, must go around intentionally screwing up their relationships for the sake of having material. Insecurity, stubbornness, and sheer stupidity bleed off of every panel. Brown's illustrative style is unimpressive as well -- too cartoony and too detailed at the same time. It freaks me out. \\n However: \\n This book is a real treat, probably because it doesn't have anything to do with Jeffrey or his screwed up relationships. It's just about his cat. These are simple, mostly wordless strips about the messes that his cat gets himself into and out of. \\n Brown brings the same keen reportage that he brings to his other comics to these cat stories, and to wonderful effect. He shows a great sense of the cat's body-language and movement, and really wonderful comedic timing. I bought this for Erin for X-Mas, and we spent much of the morning giggling in recognition at these everyday misadventures. Cat lovers and comics lovers should check it out.\"),\n",

       "  \"Now on my seventh time reading this, I still cry. DC Universe Rebirth is gonna be the one-shot comic of the decade. Seriously man, what is the reason that you haven't read this Geoff Johns baby? \\n I admit to all people, both young and old, that the New 52 has got me into reading superhero DC titles (which were limited to Alan Moore titles before that). It has then led me to collect a number of pre-new 52 titles, from Crises stories to Birthright to Animal Man etc. So whatever dogshit New 52 threw to the old world, it was clear that the reboot of fresh issue 1s gained the publisher new followers at the expense of so many fans who felt annoyed with the change. \\n So I didn't know what the DC landscape was pre-New52. I have read a bunch of stories, but not really felt the whole picture. Now I'm starting to see. And my god, it was really, really way better than New52. So many things were lost! I felt almost guilty that I didn't bother reading such rich material. It was filled with ideals and hope. \\n Now here comes DC Rebirth. It is funny that DC doesn't call it a reboot, but in fact it is a semi-reboot. Props to Geoff Johns though, because Rebirth is a restart which is done correctly. This made me research all the easter eggs. Wow. The things that DC are promising to its readers, I hope they do meet our expectations. \\n Yes I said I cried. And this is coming from someone who is not emotionally invested with the narrator. But his return was so heartfelt and genuine. Why? Well it is more than the great artwork and crisp lines. It is because Rebirth is a love letter. DC basically admitted they messed up and now is saying sorry and promises to bring back the ones that were missing yet not destroying the new. The whole story is more grounded and not like previous reboots which are lavishly grandiose and overly ambitious. Rebirth hits your fragile emotions, like a Nicholas Sparks or a Korean family movie for comic book nerds. \\n The villain reveal, oh yes! Personally (and what many feel as well), the story the villains came from is sacred ground in DC Universe and must not interact with the main DC superheroes. A big risk for them I may say. So DC better has to handle this seriously and carefully. But yes, I am extremely pumped-up to see how our DC superheroes will go against these group of baddies. \\n Read Rebirth all of you. Okay?

       "  \"Since my son is part of the newest generation of burgeoning comic book fans, and since he's been sucked into the Avengers by me and the animated films, I thought I should read this much loved pseudo-reboot of my favourite super team. Here's what I thought: \\n The Good: The best parts of Mark Millar's The Ultimates are the little flourishes of character depth that nudge the classic Marvel cast in directions they've never gone before. I can't cheer them all (I found Captain America way too gung-ho, and Bruce Banner too pathetic), but they are all effective. \\n The most convincing changes were to Henry and Janet Pym. Millar took two of the blandest, most vanilla characters in the Marvel Universe (Ant-Man and Wasp...nuff said) and made them interesting. No mean feat. And Thor's new age, anti-US, anti-military industrial complex, anti-capitalist conscience (even if it is going to be riddled with hypocrisy as the story continues) was a nice foil to the conservatism of the rest of the characters. \\n The Bad: Too much of the real world encroaches on The Ultimates universe. Freddie Prinze Jr. is a character. Seriously. Freddie Prinze Jr.! And he's a target of violence for an enraged and hormonally engorged Hulk. Even George W. Bush makes an appearance, chumming it up with General Nick Fury and sharing one of the most cringe worthy moments in The Ultimates with Captain America. Blech. \\n But the worst encroachment of all is Millar's scripting of a masturbatory movie casting fantasy, wherein Nick Fury declares that Samuel L. Jackson (which has come true) should play him; in fact, they all talk about their future cinematic manifestations. Why does this bother me? First, Millar's Nick Fury is drawn like Mace Windu-with-an-eye-patch right from the start, so we didn't need to have Millar's casting desires beaten into our heads. And one of the great joys of reading comic books is imagining -- for ourselves -- who should play our beloved super-heroes. Millar crossed a line into reader imagination, and that pisses me off. \\n The Ugly: There is a Reichstag fire moment in The Ultimates wherein Bruce Banner turns back into the Hulk and decimates part of Manhattan to ensure that The Ultimates have something to fight so they can maintain their funding. He manufactures a threat, murders people, partially destroys landmarks like Grand Central Station, and makes himself a genuine menace as destructive as any real world terrorist. It's an interesting twist, but what's ugly about it is the reaction of those involved in the cover-up (or their non-reaction). I can see Tony Stark not caring, if I suspend my disbelief, but the Captain America I know and love would never let a cover-up of the Hulk's motives and actions stand, nor would this new age Thor. Yet these two jokers share a happy little toast with Mr. Stark at the end of the sixth issue as S.H.I.E.L.D.'s funding for The Ultimates remains secure. I hope that this will change as the story arc continues (please don't tell me if it does), but I'm not liking it right now. \\n The Promising: Thor's kookiness promises to breathe life into one of Marvel's stodgiest characters. Hank and Janet's mutual abusiveness is disturbing and promises some gritty personal life realism. Tony Stark's brain tumor promises to replace his drinking as his raison d'etre (not sure I like this, but it is interesting). There was a mention of Hawkeye, and the story hints he'll be joining the team, which is great because I love him. And there's Captain America. He's my all time fave, and whether I will like the end result or not, the journey with the rebooted Cap promises to be interesting. \\n I'm not blown away, but I am sucked in.\"),\n",

       "  \"In taking over Firestorm, Dan Jurgens decided to go back to the classic model of Firestorm, with Ronnie and Jason in one body ... and it honestly feels like a bit of a waste. The earlier Firestorm actually tried to make the best of the Nu52 by rebooting in a thoughtful way ... but now we're back to basics, and we still have the deficit of a rebooted history. It's like we get the bad of the Nu52 with none of the theoretical good. But, still, it's sort of nice to see the classic Firestorm again. \\n With that said, the first three issues are a bit troublesome, because they feel like a continuation of a plot from Captain Atom (and I suspect they are). We get villains who I have no idea who are, then we get a Captain Atom already in progress, and none of that makes much sense. \\n Toward the end of the volume, I was quite please to see the return of Firestorm's entire classic villain's gallery ... except there was no rhyme nor reason to them, and very little explanation (except for Multiplex). They could have been anyone, with the result being a big piece of fan wank that didn't make much sense as a story. \\n Throughout all of this, Jurgens retains about 75% of the unfortunate Nu52 house style. There's too much fighting, and it's too decompressed (especially the extremely long cat-and-mouse game with General Eiling). On the other hand, Jurgens rebels a bit against the Nu52 hatred of supporting characters, and gives us some parents and the return of the long-comaed Tonya. (Which is really the strongest part of his run.) \\n Sadly, when Jurgens isn't writing in the Nu52 house style, he's writing in the style he used for his super comics in the '90s ... and let's say that's not very deep. \\n So, Jurgens' Firestorm is a mix of the good and the bad. More bad than good, but it's an improvement over the messy volume 2, and so I rounded up to 3 stars.\"),\n",

But behind the gloss and the blood of the painted city is hides some serious problems with the Rorschach\\'s Before Watchmen series. \\n This is the work of award-winning writer Brian Azzarello. He also did that awful Comedian series. Though Azzarello builds up the overall tone of the story and its world, he seemed to have it all wrong in characterization of Rorschach (as what he have done with the Comedian). The first thing that Watchmen fans will be looking for must be faithfulness to the original material. Deviation and personal interpretation is welcomed, but the core must be there. Rorschach is way more than a detective vigilante as what he is portrayed here in the series. He is the readers\\' eyes to whatever is happening in this world, the true watchman. Our protagonist and the narrator. \\n So you do not separately introduce a main character without him, like The Bard who I suppose is the main antagonist in this 4-issue series. Rorschach can be beat up, but it is such an utter disgrace to see him beaten. \\n I\\'m sorry to tell that the script is lazy too. No this is not a rant because I have absolutely loved Azzarello\\'s other works. Forgiven, that the journal entry narration is not at par with Alan Moore\\'s, but for the love of Dr. Manhattan, I never expected that he will commit the \"never leave a character to die without making sure about his death\" cliche. \\n The \"bad people leaving without seeing the protagonist really die\" cliche \\n To be fair, Rorschach is accurately depicted as brutal and very capable of fighting mano-a-mano against many. \\n Going back with the art, Bermejo\\'s illustrations alone make this issue worth seeing. Although at some panels, Rorschach\\'s inkblots looked like they\\'re just being glued into the fabric. Also, why doesn\\'t Rorschach wear pinstripe pants? \\n It\\'s too early to judge if this series will go bad. It has some serious flaws yes, but it deserves another chance.'),\n",

       "  'Set the Way-Back Machine to November 1980. Today, it\\'s hard to realize how ground-breaking The New Teen Titans was, but it was something that DC Comics hadn\\'t seen before, except perhaps in their far-flung Legion of Super-Heroes comics: it was a modern-day DC comic, written in the Marvel style. That means it was about heroes who were more than just heroes: they were real people with real problems. \\n Wolfman did a good job of recreating the classic DC character that make up half the cast. Changeling becomes a hero, rather than a sidekick. Flash reluctantly returns to his days in tights. Wonder Girl starts to lay down the roots of the too-often repeating mystery, \"Who is Donna Troy?\" But it\\'s Dick Grayson who gets the best attention, because The New Teen Titans was his coming-of-age story. \\n However it\\'s the new heroes that are even more impressive, because Wolfman embeds them deeply into stories of conflict that not only define who they are, but also act as a constantly renewing source of plot threads. Raven is a bit too much of a mystery here, but nonetheless it\\'s her background as the daughter of Trigon that generates most of this volume\\'s plot movement. Koriand\\'r has a story that\\'s at least as interesting, with a her fall from grace in a galactic empire. (We\\'ll see more of that a few volumes down the road.) Cyborg seems to get the short end of the stick, with his story mainly focusing on disagreements with his father ... but maybe it\\'s just that he has a more human story. \\n Even when not focusing on the creation of the Titans and their first encounter with Trigon, Wolfman manages to make great use of his story pages. It\\'s entirely amazing that Terminator and the first Ravager are introduced almost as an aside in the second issue. Shockingly, that same issue also introduces HIVE to the DC universe! The Fearsome Five are less notable (and less revolutionary), but they nonetheless are introduced here as part of the first Trigon saga, and would go on to be another of the Titans\\' most long-lived foes. \\n Though it shines in its character design and the plot foundations they create, The New Teen Titans is also very much a product of its time, with all that suggests. It\\'s heavily compressed and very wordy; there\\'s not a lot of chance for the story to breathe. There\\'s also a heavy emphasis on fighting, which too often sets the characters aside. However when Wolfman instead presents a character interlude, as is the case in #7 and particularly #8, then the comic shines.These stories offer beautiful character moments and emotions that are very well earned, such as Victor\\'s reconciliation with his father and Koriand\\'r\\'s acceptance of Earth. These moments are what really made Wolfman\\'s New Teen Titans great, and it\\'s wonderful to see them on display so early in the series.'),\n",

It's a very interesting situation. The basic gist is that after his wife breaks his tar, Nasser Ali, a great musician, is unable to find a suitable replacement and thus decides to die. He goes to bed and 8 days later he dies. Over the course of these 8 days we learn about his life. \\n Nasser is not a particularly likable character in the beginning. Neither is his wife really and their son also seems a bit annoying. However it is those 8 days and the memories of the past and the visions of what will come that explain why these characters are the way they are. \\n In truth it is a sad story. Perhaps since I have just finished reading it the entire weight of it has not completely settled, but I do not feel for the main character as much as I feel his situation should warrant. \\n I suppose this is because the characters are faulty, in a very realistic way. Indeed this is a true story of Satrapi's uncle and his family. Satrapi does a good job of showing us this in an unbiased way and it makes for a very interesting story. What is revealed at the end definitely pulls it all together. Though I feel for the characters I do not necessarily like them or their decisions, but I still like the book. This is something tricky to do and I think Satrapi pulls it off well. \\n In fact the only day I question is the 7th day when his sister comes to visit... or does she? Perhaps he imagines this. It takes place in one page. The book isn't very long and some more time could have been spent on this issue I think. If I have any negative comments about the book is that it could indeed have been just a little bit longer. All the other day's lengths feel appropriate and have good pacing.\"),\n",

I will say that unlike many multi-title x-overs, the story was very coherent and relatively engrossing the whole way through. The problems were a repetition of very similar feeling beats in just about every issue, really uneven pacing, and occasionally incomprehensible art work. When you have one large group of mutants jumping into a panel to pound another large group of mutants, things tend to get very confused very fast, and there were a lot of these confrontations.

So I thought I'd see if my local library had any of this series in, and it did. And I totally enjoyed and loved this book, it was beautiful and fun and amazing and just what I fancied reading one afternoon after a short day at work. \\n The Plot: This graphic novel has a fantastic and well-paced story line that was totally enjoyable if a little predictable. \\n I loved the way the fantasy was woven in, it's not a theme I've seen that often in urban fantasy and I really enjoyed it. I liked the whole house element as well, the house as a theme is really well done and makes you want to explore your own home all over again (I'm thinking the next time I move I could be enforcing a sleepover with my poor much maltreated own family) and just double check everything is where it should be. \\n The story itself is a tad predictable but it is so beautifully told and so sweet and cute that you don't mind, and there is enough different to make it stand out and make it just the greatest. Gosh, the way it unfolds is great and I love it. All the themes running through it of family, loyalty, betrayal, and all that are great and handled so well. \\n The Characters: The main character in this book is the adorable Emily who is a young girl who is going through a difficult time all of which is totally explained right at the beginning of the book, and she really likes wearing hoodies (she's identifiable in that she seems kind of normalish for a fantasy novel) and she loves her family. After moving to her Great-Uncles home and having a major cleaning session, and some great family bonding moments, Emily finds a necklace of some kind that helps her discover a few things about her family's history and gives her the power to protect her family hey she loves them okay. And the rather cool fantasy element is then introduced. \\n Emily's little brother Navin is a total cutie too, and such a sweetheart in this story. One of my favourite parts of this book was the relationship between Emily and Navin, I love books with beautifully written family relationships that are not just assumed or brushed aside. I also loved how real Navin felt, his personality just jumped at me and he really reminded me of my own little brother. \\n Also Emily and Navin's Mum who was totally great, I loved her and how much she loved her children (and also their Dad was pretty cool you know and stuff). Yeah, great parenting love in this book. I loved it. A lot. \\n And the others. If you've read this then you know who I mean, like literally the greatest characters the elf dude was epic and the robots DUDE THE ROBOTS! and the house, cannot state how much I loved the whole house thing and great development and I totally want volume two like yesterday (but I don't think my library has them). \\n My Thoughts: This book, graphic novel, is fantastic and one of the best things I have read in years and is not diminished at all by the fact that it is aimed at a younger audience. Their is a certain childishness to it but the way it's told makes it relatable to everyone, at any age. \\n The images are beautiful and take show not tell as the most brilliant advice.

Fables is and probably will be for a very long time part of my must read list.\"),\n",

       "  'Volume covers chapters 7-13 \\n See full review of first 2 volumes at Katie\\'s Corner \\n I loved it from the beginning to the end; well it yet had to be translated to English the last chapters, but whatever. I think if you have read my review on Unmasked Noise, you might have noticed that I said a bit about Crayon Days, I didn\\'t want to start this manga because of several things. First one was because it was about painting and I didn\\'t think that the Black & White could transform colors. And the other one was because it was not finished being translated yet. I sincerely apologize for the first one, because while reading this manga I was really thinking that colours were coming to life on my tablet. \\n The story is about a young girl - Shima, who loves to paint and because of that she leaves fro Tokyo to study arts. There the amazing adventures of a country girl start. On the very first day she meets the person she will soon fall in love with - Saki Akatsuki. He is a genius painter, and quite an eccentric one too. When he sees her looking at his work-in-progress, he just rips the canvas saying, \"don\\'t look!\" Their relationship began not as great as it would have been thought. Saji is a pervert and a sadist, while Shima, who is a country bumpkin, knows her value and though in the beginning they can\\'t stand each other, very soon they will reveal their feelings. However, will everything be as easy as it seems? \\n This manga is really amazing. Every page of it radiates positive feelings, and you just can\\'t put it down. Every chapter leaves you wanting more. Shima and Saji are really great characters; you love Shima for her simplicity and for her kindness. Even though Saji might seem bad in the beginning, he has a really nice side to him. They are artists from the bottom of their heart. The moments when they are engrossed in painting are the best parts of the whole manga. Another quite interesting character is Inocchi, that\\'s Saji\\'s friend. He is really mysterious. I still don\\'t get it, if he really likes Shima or is just having fun with her. \\n Thought the 16th chapter does give some clues about his behavious. However, it doesn\\'t only give that, at the end of the chapter a love-rival for Shima appears. Who is she? I do have my ideas, and they can\\'t be wrong, but I am not saying anything. It\\'s up to you to fin out! \\n I hope you will find some time to read this story. You will love it a lot, both the art and the plot too. As always Chiba Kozue brings us an amazing story to read. Enjoy it to its fullest. Have fun and don\\'t forget to leave your thoughts below. Stay tuned for more reviews and promos on Katie\\'s Corner. Happy reading!'),\n",

       "  'Four Devils, One Hell is mostly about Mantovari, a Private Eye working for a dead client. He was hired on to find the murderer of a man\\'s brother, but his client was murdered when he starts really looking into the case. He ends up following it up because he thinks it is the right thing to do, and he doesn\\'t really seem to have anything else anyway. This leads him to New Orleans, aptly dubbed \"Hell.\" There are other very interesting characters involved through the journey. I am quite partial to both Bixby, the previous accountant gone mad, and Calhoun the honest gambler. \\n The writing is excellent, though the entire thing is rather brief. I think there could have been a lot more story involved and characterization. There were times where I thought I was missing a page because it seemed to jump too suddenly in the writing. \\n The artwork is about as good as I have seen. The illustration is very nice and the painting/coloring work is just amazing. I absolutely loved the work and I often found myself looking closer at the drawings trying to pick out different things. \\n This is definitely, definitely for adults. There is blood and gore on nearly every turn of the page and a fair amount of sex thrown in as well. \\n This is by far one of my favorite graphic novels'),\n",

There are lots of great character details here, but very little happens with the main plot, and so a lot of it feels like wheel-spinning. \\n Silver Surfer. An OK story with OK art. I like the character arc for Silver Surfer, but unfortunately it's held back with a lot of fighting against Ravenous, a character that I don't care about (apparently because he'd never appeared before coming out of nowhere for this comic) [5+/10]. \\n Super-Skrull. This mini-series was all about character, and it does a pretty good job of making both the Super-Skrull and his rag-tag band into real characters. There's a bit too much fighting sometime, but it's a cute story [6+/10]. \\n Ronan. An interesting character study of Ronan and nice artwork, but much of the story isn't very connected to the Annihilation Wave, and thus feels all over the place. [6/10] \\n Another problem that I have with these mini-series is inconsistency. They just don't feel like they meld together into a cohesive whole. Variable representations of the annihilation horde were the most obvious: Giffen depicts them as silent killers, while they're absolutely chatty in some of the other mini-series.\"),\n",

There are so many emotions, that you can not put down the manga. Even though you already know what has to happen, the realisation strikes you hard. One of the best parts is the crossover with the present and the future in 10 years. Those chapters are just spectacular, because you get to see characters from a different point of view and when you see them at present you get to think : \"wow, that guy has guts to tell his past self to do this!\" \\n I do not really want to talk more about this manga, so I do not accidentally slip something.

I may be lying about romance, as I\\'ve been mostly covering that on my blog. But it was quite a long time since I enjoyed the romantic comedy so much. I read the manga in June and wrote a review also in June, but I totally forgot about I, and well, here it is now. I re-read it a bit so I could rewrite some parts of the review. \\n First of all, I never really paid attention to the \"You May Also Like\" widget on Goodreads. So, if you are like that too, I highly recommend you to check it sometimes. I mean I found this awesome story because I looked at that widget and to say the truth I found many more interesting mangas there. I\\'ll cover them sometime soon. Okay, let me get back to the story.

Even when I finish a completed manga I always have this feeling of seeing something more, but not this time. Somehow, even though I didn\\'t really want to say goodbye to the characters that grew on to me, the goodbye was quite okay. Everything came to some kind of conclusion and I was very content with all answers. \\n The story has lots of fun moments, but at the same time there were many things that made you think. The stereotypes of good schools and bad schools were what the author focused on. I believe she wanted to show us, that we should never put everyone under one umbrella. Sometimes, even delinquents can be good. Both Aoi and Hayato are amazing characters. There is a lot of character development in the 15 chapters and not only for one character but for both. Though it is more Aoi that changes. But if you do think about, it was more about Aoi than Hayato. I do believe there was not much of Hayato\\'s development. He was an awesome male character from the very beginning. The way he had fun on Aoi, and the way he concealed his true feelings from her, were adorable.

       "  'Boxing Days (86). It\\'s nice to get some background on Mr. Dark, and the Boxers are quite a neat creation, but this is otherwise a story without any surprises or twists [5+/10]. \\n Witches (87-91). This is very much the middle of the Mr. Dark arc, meaning that it\\'s all setup. Nonetheless, it\\'s an interesting setup. Bufkin\\'s story is the best, because he gets exciting action dealing with the problems creating when Mr. Dark let all the monsters out. Meanwhile, the eponymous Witches of the arc title give us great insight into a group that we didn\\'t know a lot about, while rearranging the playing field in preparation for a big future battle. Overall, this makes me excited about what\\'s coming [7/10]. \\n Ball Game (92-93). \"And they lived happily ever after?\" \"Not exactly.\" That\\'s pretty much the messaging of the whole Fables series, and it\\'s used to good effect here, where we investigate what\\'s going on in Flycatcher\\'s kingdom after the war. The beginning, which feels like a tribute to \"Casey at the Bat\", is a bit weak, but once you really dive into Flycatcher\\'s dilemma, the story strengthens, especially when it morphs to be a story about Flycatcher himself [8/10]. \\n Rose Red (94-98). The Rose Red story is a little uncomfortable because the first issue (94) is such a tight continuation of the previous arc. However, once we get into the Rose Red backstory (95-97), it takes a turn toward greatness. The history of Rose and Snow was long-awaited and is a really fun mishmash of different fairy tales. In turn, when we get back to the modern day (97-98) we also get a real nice turn around, after what seems like some wheel-spinning since the start of the \"Witches\" arc. It\\'s especially nice to see Rose return to her strengths (although it makes the last story arc of Fables, several years down the road, seem even more like character assassination in comparison) [8+/10] \\n The Duel (99-100). A wonderful setup for the big duel and some good closure ... until the whole thing anticlimaxes. In the end it feels like a big cheat, like Willingham wanted to have something major for the 100th issue, but wasn\\'t willing to let go of Mr. Dark yet. Still, at least we get a big change in the status quo, so this arc isn\\'t a total waste [5+/10]. \\n This is definitely the raw middle of the Dark arc, and it\\'s a little rough, but there\\'re some strong bits too, particularly the Rose and Snow backstory.'),\n",

       "  \"Killmonger Continues to Return (18-20). The Killmonger plot continues, and it's an interesting blend of machinations and fighting. This all feels a bit decompressed, but is still a good read. [7/10]. \\n Dead Again (21-22). A dying Black Panther travels through the dream realms, and this sort of thing is almost always dull and uninteresting. And it is here too. Meanwhile, the cool bit, of Killmonger taking over as Black Panther, seems to be constrained to the Avengers comic! [5/10] \\n Cat Trap (23, DP44). Killpanther: hilarious. Priest's Deadpool: hilarious. The Avengers reacting to all of this: hilarious. Priest Avengers? Please! Please! Please! The whole Killmonger plot by this point had gotten a little long and serious, so this was a great return to form for Priest. [8/10]. \\n Malice (24-25). The Killpanther plot comes to a rather abrupt halt that would have felt like an anticlimax if Priest's writing weren't so fun. Still, there's some shocking drama here, and some interpersonal connections going back to the start of the book. And somehow it avoids being totally derailed despite a crossover with a horrible Avengers plot. [8/10] \\n Sturm Und Drang (26-29). A big political story is a great plot for Priest's Black Panther, and this one is quite interesting with its incorporation of Deviants, Atlantis, and even Dr. Doom. It does start off a bit slow with over an issue devoted to Storm, but once it gets going it's quite interesting [7/10]. \\n The Story Thus Far (30). The history of a WWII Cap entering Wakanda is sublime, but it's unfortunately part of a mediocre modern-day story whose main focus seems to be closing up plot threads [6+/10]. \\n Seduction of the Innocent & Gorilla Warfare (31-35). The intertwining series of stories that finish off the volume are great for how they return to some of the classic plots that began Black Panther. It's good to see a conclusive story about Malice (though Priest for some reason doesn't quite pull the trigger on finishing the plot), while the return of Mephisto is great particularly for its hilarious humor. However, the highlight may actually be the new plot about Queen and Man-Ape. All around, a fine conclusion ... other than the irritating fact that it ends on two cliffhangers!) [7/10] \\n Overall, this volume isn't as strong as its predecessor. Ross too often fades into the background, and we lose a lot of the delightful timey-wimeyness of Priest's storytelling. I also think the initial story with Killmonger goes on too longer and costs the volume a lot of its forward momentum. Still, this isn't a normal superhero book. It's got funny characters and goes far beyond stupid fighting.\"),\n",

       "  'Having been recently pained by being forced to describe one of my all-time favorite writers take on one of my all-time favorite DC teams as \"all that could go wrong with the New 52, Jeff Lemire\\'s captivating take on Green Arrow might (just might!) make me reconsider my views on the entire relaunch enterprise. Here is a writer whose work just drips with so pathos, drama, and storytelling talent that the volume is almost impossible to put down. Like others, I\\'ve only read a bit of the first 16 issues of the Green Arrow relaunch and found little to impress. Lemire locates the beating heart at the center of Oliver Queen -- a character in a way always trying to find himself and his purpose - and shows a great deal of humility in borrowing generously from the popular (and fun!) television adaption, Arrow, pulling some of the best bits into his story. One can also detect his appreciation of Kevin Smith\\'s excellent take on Green Arrow of some years ago. Yet it is what Lemire brings as new that really makes this book sing. \\n Lemire digs deep in order to broaden and deepen the Green Arrow mythos. A whole new back story threat fits neatly into all that has gone before and yet also changes everything. Also in the spirit of the New 52, Lemire revisits some old (and perhaps tired) villains breathing life into their stories and motivations. Not to give too much away, this certainly isn\\'t your dad\\'s Count Vertigo. Lemire also impressively recognizes that Green Arrow\\'s success depends on how interesting he can make its title character; in the finest tradition of cold hearted writers, he shows an excellent willingness to explode his character\\'s entire life in order to reveal his true motivations. \\n My praise of this book would be incomplete if I failed to mention the wonderful artwork of Andrea Sorrentino. Lemire\\'s script is emotionally heavy and packed with action, yet this could all land with a thud if brushed by an average artist. Sorrentino\\'s work proves that she is anything but. Remembering that Green Arrow isn\\'t superpowered (and here is returned to his youth), Sorrentino gives the reader page after page of emotional intensity and fluid action. We see the surprise in Oliver\\'s eyes when he feels surprise. We recognize his pain and his doubt in Sorrentino\\'s sharp lines. Look no further than the cover to see her gifts. Just extraordinary. \\n To answer a question sure to come, yes, if you\\'ve picked up not a single issue of Green Arrow before, you can certainly start here. I found myself with a few questions, but Lemire made sure to answer them as he moved the story along, all without slowing down. As for me, I can tell you that I won\\'t be missing another of his issues. Yes, it really is that good. \\n A free copy was provided by DC Comics through NetGalleys in exchange for an honest review.'),\n",

       "  \"Batman: The Dark Knight Returns is a comic book classic I had longed to read for quite some time. Frank Miller is one of the great names one associates with superhero comics, since he helped establish the genre after the decline in the 70s. (Unfortunately, he is aware of this.) He is doubly famous because of the recent movie adaptations of his work - Sin City and 300. \\n The Batman we see in The Dark Knight Returns is old, bitter and sad. He has added Jason Todd, a former Robin, to the ghosts who haunt him, and is now trying to ammend his life by subsidizing the recovery of the Arkham Asylum interns. Rampant crime plagues Gotham, free of its vigilante. When Harvey Dent goes back to his former habits the moment he sets his foot outside Arkham, Bruce Wayne decides he has to embrace his masked identity and put a stop to all the madness. First as a background and then as the overarching storyline, a nuclear war looms in Gotham, giving depth to the grittiness and darkness of this world. In a magistral turn of the screw, this apocalyptic atmosphere is starkly contrasted with the vacuity of day-to-day life, represented by vapid news anchors. \\n I enjoyed the appearances/name-dropping of other comic-book characters, such as Superman, Selina Kyle (Catwoman), Oliver Queen (Green Arrow) and Diana (Wonder Woman). But I truly hated what he has done to the women portrayed - I had trouble recognizing Lana Lang, and Selina has been turned to an old, fat and sad prostitue in charge of a brothel. I know Catwoman isn't characterized exactly by a strict moral code, but I think that she is downright out-of-character here. Miller has written either whores, damsels or dykes, and is thouroughly incapable of understanding that women are human, too. I've heard that Miller's Robin (Carrie Kelley) is the only exception, but is it, really? She kicks ass because she has to, but has the depth of a piece of paper. We never get to know her motives, or any kind of background, or any personality trait, for that matter. \\n The main conflict is a product of the 80s - nuclear war, the tension between the USSR and the US, and the preoccupation with mass media consumption. It really couldn't have been written in a different decade. However, it isn't atemporal as a great classic should be. While Watchmen (another comic which deals with similar concerns) has succeeded, The Dark Knight Returns is dated. Ultimately, the story is only entertaining and not life-changing or moving. On the other hand, this bitter and twisted Batman was definitely a good departure from the campy character of the older comics. It cleared the way for modern superhero comics, featuring more mature and complex characters. In fact, the lauded Batman trilogy directed by Nolan owes a lot to Miller's vision. \\n I also didn't enjoy this from a technical point of view. This is a personal preference, but I think that while Miller's penciler skills worked wonders in Sin City, they don't look good in Batman, and even drag out the pace. In contrast, Varley is flawless and the color seriously improves the artwork. The narrative was subpar as well - the sentences were repetitive and over-the-top, very juvenile in a way. I'm just glad I've read this because of its status and its importance, but I think it just hasn't stood the test of time.\"),\n",

He twisted the familiar, trying to make something new. Indeed, Ellison pioneered so many Science Fiction novelties, that one may well suspect that many of his famous lawsuits for infringements on his plot ideas result, perhaps, from his ideas osmotically binding into the DNA of our collective unconscious. Now pushing eighty (!), Ellison just keeps on experimenting. And so we come to his recent graphic venture, \"Seven Against Chaos.\" \\n If you hear that title and imagine you might be getting something borrowing from \"Seven Against Thebes,\" put that right out of your mind. This is the Seven Samurai (or given the guns, perhaps the western adaption, The Magnificent Seven) all the way. Ellison takes Kurosawa\\'s tale of seven lonely samurai bound together to save a village, mashes it together with some material that brings to mind the best of the old scifi pulps and serials, and creates something wholly new. Now we have seven lonely citizens of the wider solar system, brought together by a mysterious hooded figure. In exchange for granting each something akin to his or heart\\'s desire, they will follow the man in the hood through time and space to save the earth, and perhaps save reality. \\n Ellison\\'s work here doesn\\'t exude the sort of subtlety of character found in much of his other work, nor the sheer rage found in his best essays. Instead, he\\'s taking you on a wild ride that includes everything from robots to space princesses to dinosaurs (and I will say nothing more about either, in order to avoid possible spoilers).

Present-day Bruce, in particular, seems off in some way that I can\\'t quite define except to say that it involves cheekbones and jowls, although it\\'s clear that he\\'s an older version of flashback Bruce. The younger characters, especially flashback Bruce, are really well designed -- it makes me wonder, actually, if Natsume usually draws teenagers! And it is amusing to see college-age Bruce absolutely towering over everyone in the dojo where he\\'s staying. The art definitely doesn\\'t suffer for being in black and white, especially in the \"demon\" fight scenes with wavering greyscale opponents. The story is pretty much standard Batman-fights-some-criminals-while-pondering-life, but that\\'s a successful formula most of the time, and it\\'s done well here. The time spent on Bruce -- as opposed to Batman -- is refreshing. I had a good laugh at the start of the story when Bruce spots Aya; he\\'s all, \"Wow, she looks just like a girl I used to know when I was in training,\" and everyone else is all, \"Wow, playboy Bruce goes right for the only woman in the room again.\" Okay, I suppose that nudges it up to four stars. \\n Also, on a side note, I really do prefer manga-sized comics.

Certain things are different, but the themes of this volume reflect the state of the US perfectly. Civil War II is Team Captain Marvel vs. Team Iron Man. Carol believes Ulysses, an Inhuman that can predict the probability of a crime happening, is the solution to stopping crime by stopping it before it happens. Tony believes it's wrong to lock people up for crimes they haven't even committed yet. Kamala is unfortunately stuck in the middle. She sees both Carol and Tony as her mentors, and while she sees the benefits of Carol's predictive crime methods, she ultimately realizes life is more complicated than that when people are involved. \\n This volume raises important questions. Is Ulysses and his predictive abilities similar to profiling, a practice used by law enforcement that more often than not, targets certain groups of people because they fall under a certain demographic? Is it ok to detain people before they've even committed an actual crime, merely because there's a high possibility they will commit a crime? These are the questions and dilemmas Kamala is faced with while her personal life and superhero life clash once again. \\n Paralleling this were the pages that detailed the Khan family's journey over several generations, from Mumbai to Karachi, and then finally New Jersey. As a dual citizen, sometimes Kamala doesn't really feel like she belongs in either America or Pakistan. Although I was not born in Malaysia like Kamala, I do feel very much like I'm a part of two worlds. I'm not quite American enough because of my ethnicity, but I also feel inadequate around my family members with my accented Cantonese. It's tough, feeling like you don't quite belong wherever you go.

However, this was the story that truly turned them into real people, not just secondary characters and not just knockoffs of the JLA (though they continue to wear their Justice League origins on their sleeves). The character studies in this mini-series are wonderful and often full of heart. \\n However, this comic is truly great because it's one of the great superhero deconstructions of the '80s, right up there with Miracle Man, The Watchmen, and The Dark Knight. It imagines what heroes would do if they were going to change the world and what they would do if faced with human foibles. So Dr. Spectrum (Green Lantern) is more self-absorbed and selfish than Hal Jordon ever was; Nuke (Firestorm) is actually radioactive and causing the death of his parents; and Tom Thumb (Atom) is unsure of his place in the Squadron. The list goes on. \\n The plot of changing the world is a great one, because it's the sort of thing that superheroes should think of, but it was rarely even considered in earlier Ages. The Squadron Supreme may be the most complete investigation ever of the trope. It's not surprising that it inevitably leads the Fight of the Titans that also seems common in deconstructionist superhero stories of this type ... but Greenwald doesn't pull any punches, and the result is tense and heart breaking. \\n By the time you get done with this mini-series, your mood should be hovering somewhere between awe and the desire to read more [10/10]. \\n Death of a Universe. After the scope and innovation of the Squadron Supreme series, this is somewhat of a disappointment. It's just a fairly normative (albeit well-written) superhero comic. It's great to see the Squad again, and it's great to follow-up on the miniseries just a week later. The artwork is also quite nice here, primarily (I think) due to the coloring.

Batwoman's body and lush and sexy but never objectified. She embodies strength and awesomeness. The city of Gotham is drawn with contrasts: dark skylines and grey streets stomped over by throngs of supernatural beings, costumed heroes and low-level thugs of gold. There's blood and gore and weird filthy mythology all around the place. With beautiful panels to frame the Gotham scene, you'd just want to sit back and appreciate what your eyes are seeing. \\n But this third volume of Batwoman is far from being perfect, I thoroughly enjoyed it hence the 5 stars yet there are some things that I wanted to point out. World's Finest is too wordy. Well, ancient mythological characters tend to be talkative so there's that excuse. It is entertaining to read for a while but towards the end these words drag you down.

But the main plot, involving Lady Bullseye, is overly mysterious and totally inconclusive.

(I think it doesn\\'t help that these characters were totally dropped from Matt\\'s mythology pretty soon after Brubaker\\'s run.) \\n With that all said, this is still a solid ending for Brubaker\\'s run that closes off his major Kingpin story and also concludes his smaller arcs involving Milla and Dakota.

But I know that the original is quite different, as is often the case with Disneyfied versions. I still recall with horror my innocent read of The Hunchback of Notre Dame. \\n Apparently, Regis Loisel remains true to the spirit of the original, inventing a dark origin story for Peter, with a Dickensian childhood in Victorian London, several mommy issues, and ties to Jack the Ripper. It's dark indeed and at times weird, but it all makes for a compelling and believable anti-bildungsroman, the evolution from Peter, the kid on the cusp of his teenage years, to Peter Pan, the kid who never grows up. It also made me uncomfortable, which clearly was something Loisel intended. Stereotypes had no small part on my disgust, but they are very special stereotypes. Neverland stems from Peter - it is what Peter wants it to be, and it is populated by characters that Peter fancies, which explains the Piccaninny Indians and the black pirate. It's not pretty, but it makes sense in his Victorian child's worldview. Same goes for sirens and faeries and any women in the story - they are only allowed to be mother/saints or whores. Basically, they are simplifications of the women Peter has encountered on his life so far. \\n The filter of Peter's mind still puzzles me on some issues: Rose and Hook. Hook is almost a literal father figure, since Peter's father abandoned his pregnant lover to sail towards unknown places. Curiously, Hook looks like the pedophile who assaults him on his way home. What does this mean? It feels like Freudian imagery, but I can't make any sense of it. Then there's Rose, who is eaten by the Guardian. Who I think is time itself, since he is a ticking crocodile.

       "  'For those who don\\'t know Jodorowsky, this may only be 2 or 3 stars. For those who know Jodorowsky through his two most famous films (El Topo and Holy Mountain) this may be more solidly a 3 star work. For those like me who have heard him talk about Hollywood (such as in the movie Jodorowsky\\'s Dune), the parallels are clear and the cliches are not as detrimental. \\n The Technopriests is written as two interwoven stories. The link between the two stories appears at the start ... though there are hints that our main characters may meet again after their transformations. In story one, we meet Panephra, once virgin oracle to a long forgotten god that is raped by three space pirates. After birthing three children from this rape, Panephra swears revenge on the pirates. She starts off manufacturing Space Cheese to fund her revenge, using two of her three children as slaves and the third she values above the others. Story one follows Panephra and two of her children as she seeks her revenge. Story two follows the third child, Albino, who is sold by his mother to the technocrats upon hearing his wish to be a video game creator. Albino has a talent and his goal is to use video games to enlighten the world ... but the technocrats only want video games to enslave and dumb down the masses. \\n Panephra\\'s story is full of the violence Jodorowsky\\'s movies are noted for. Lots of body parts vaporized, lots of blood, some misogynistic treatment of women (Jodorowsky has explained in interviews that writes stories from a virile and very masculine perspective ... I\\'m conflicted here since that really doesn\\'t excuse his mistreatment of women in movies, but he also uses all characters - regardless of gender - as symbols and representatives of the Tarot ... so, yeah), and a glimpse of spiritual battle. This is the weakest of the two stories, full of bad writing and cliched lines (including, \"You may take my body, but you\\'ll never have my soul\"). Until the end of the book (which is only the first of 5 parts ... and the third comic of fifteen?), it lacks the additional weight of Jodorowsky\\'s other work; it\\'s missing the spiritual core that takes weak characters and makes them into symbolic pillars. \\n Albino\\'s story is where I am more engaged. This is because Albino\\'s story is really Jodorowsky\\'s story. Albino\\'s battle to make transcendent video games is Jodo\\'s battle to make beautiful movies. Sure, it is a tad repetitive, but I\\'ve always found watching an author exorcise demons to be incredibly fulfilling (which is why I enjoy Stephen King so much). And that\\'s what this series boils down to. This is Jodo exorcising his anger against Hollywood and the way They do business. Quite possibly, these two stories are one and the same. Panephra is Jodo\\'s id, seeking the violent revenge and expressing his anger in the most direct manner. Albino is his superego, seeking to rectify the situation despite countless odds. \\n I shall find and finish this series, but it is not a series I recommend without prior knowledge of Jodorowsky.'),\n",

These are nice stories for how they paint on a wide canvas with lots of one-off characters. \"Loyalties\" is the better, probably due to Ostrander\\'s writing, but also because it shows the Empire\\'s officers being forced into their new jobs, in a way that gives you sympathy for them [8/10]. \"Into the Unknown\" instead shows the downfall of the Jedi, and that it\\'s not as surprising or tightly written, it\\'s still a nice piece about a changing galaxy [7/10]. Both of these stories have very attractive art too. \\n Purge. The Empire ascends and Vadar kills a bunch of Jedi. It\\'s a nice bit of continuity, following on from Episode III, but it really doesn\\'t make for a very suspenseful plot. Ostrander\\'s stories exemplify the problem: they\\'re good enough, but after writing the story once in the original Purge, he then has to play wacky games with chronology in his second outing (\"Seconds to Die\") to keep things interesting. (Admittedly, he succeeds.) Blackman similarly has to offer a big twist (\"The Hidden Blade\") to keep his readers on their toes. Nonetheless, all of these stories are shallow, repetitive, and not that interesting [5/10]. \\n Purge: The Tyrant\\'s Fist. Freed is the only author to do anything interesting with the Purge, possibly because he has two issues to tell his story. As a result, he gets to detail minor characters and create a deeper story. However, he also offers a big twist on the Purge and uses it as a bookend to the entire sequence [7/10] \\n Darth Vader & The Lost Command. This is a nice arc mainly for its depiction of Darth Vader. I\\'m not convinced that it matches the other comics from the immediate post-III period, but Blackman does a great job of depicting a Vader who is still uncertain of himself and unrespected by his fellows. It\\'s a really nice transition between III and IV, between Anakin and Vader. This arc\\'s only problem is that it\\'s too decompressed. Too many pages go by with few words and many pictures, making this a very quick read. [7/10] \\n Dark Times (1-5). This is a nice continuation of the characters and plots from issues #79-80 of The Republic. I particularly enjoy the Jedi Dass Jennir, who\\'s being painted with a delicacy that Lucas could have wished for in the prequel trilogy. The plotline and art are also great [7+/10]. \\n Overall, I love this careful collection of a variety of material set in the same time period. Unfortunately, it also shows off the weaknesses of this sort of compilation. Vader, the Emperor, and their relationship seems all over the place throughout this volume, without the consistency I\\'d like to see. Still, there are lots of good stories here, that feel like they have more depth than recent Marvel publications because the Dark Horse authors were painting on a larger canvas.'),\n",

And I\\'d have to agree, both of those decisions are really, horribly, terribly dumb. Beyond that, the volume has a lot of bad art (that\\'s humorous only because it shows the lockstep badness of art in the Image era) and shockingly bad costume design (where a few geometric squiggles on a plain body stocking were thought somehow to be cool or evocative) and too many randomly sideways pages (which are more annoying than ever in a heavy omnibus). \\n But, it\\'s got a fair amount going for it as well. \\n The core plot of Kang wanting to conquer the past by subverting the Avengers was great, as was the idea that Tony had been manipulated at some point; when you add in a time-created ringer in Force Works, things became even more interesting. The writers also weren\\'t afraid to offer some developments that had repercussions, including the deaths of several minor characters. With strong writing underlining this \"notorious\" storyline, there\\'s really quite a lot to like, and most it is very readable. I also quite enjoyed seeing the end of two *very* \\'90s comics, Force Works and War Machine. \\n Looking back from the future, knowing that the stupidest results of the crossover were reversed, my only real complaint about this storyline is that too many things didn\\'t make sense in the end. I didn\\'t entirely understand what Kang\\'s plan was, nor why it might have been bad to oppose it, nor how he\\'d manipulated Stark, nor how much control Stark was under.

       "  \"This graphic novel is really one for Alan Moore completists and for those interested in the post-modern punk creativity of the world of Malcolm McLaren. \\n It is a Phantom of the Opera/Beauty and the Beast mash-up centred on a caricature of a fashion industry and set in the sort of dystopian world which seemed to exercise Moore in the Thatcher era. \\n But the novel is more interesting as an attempt by Moore to respond to a cinematic brief. It simply confirms that Moore and filmic thought simply do not get on. If anything, it is closer to a musical theatre adaptation! \\n He is famously withering about the film adaptations of his stories (which are all generally well received by film-lovers). This was an early chance to think a story along filmic lines and he clearly could not do so easily. \\n The work was initiated as a commission by the late cultural impresario McLaren who could think in multiple forms but needed others to put in place his vision. Moore cannot even remember the date of the commission. \\n The artist commissioned to complete the project for 2013 tries his best to make it filmic but it does not work because the story line is classic Alan Moore - a literary creation to be told in a succession of fixed images. \\n The point of film is that it blurs and moves and our mind's eye settles into passivity. The comic book, like the novel, requires that things be filled in actively and remembered with some attention. \\n All that happens with a graphic novel is that certain imaginative choices are removed which are permitted in the literary novel and the reader is even more constrained, leaving him or her to invent the meaning and the transitions. \\n Graphic novels give us more space to imagine the world in which the story is set but at the cost of guiding us with some rigour down just one path within it. The literary novel is more seductive and requires us to visualise. \\n Unfortunately, the ilustrations of Facundo Percio are part of the problem - there was a choice between portraying Mooresque dystopia or fashion as glamour and Percio and Moore made the wrong choice. \\n The dystopian aspects of the story frankly seem a little hackneyed (especially when compared to Moore's masterworks, 'V for Vendetta' and 'Watchmen', and even 'Halo Jones' and 'Skizz') and should just have been a back drop. \\n What should have been emphasised is fashion as glamour and so allow the work to be a bridge from the past to the later Moore fascination with the magical and how things can apparently come out of nothing to have meaning. \\n As it is, the illustration plays up the weakness of the story line as Moore attempts and fails to think in filmic terms. It needed glamour. \\n Another theme of Moore - sexual transformation - is also weakly handled. The boy who is a girl who is a boy and the girl who is a boy who is a girl is standard fare in Japanese manga and serves its transgressional purpose well. \\n Here, though, there is an odd diffidence. The theme should be erotic - even if sublimated erotic - and neither character contains much of the transgressional eroticism found in manga versions. Neither are 'appealing' visually. \\n Again, this is an early exploration of the sexual by Moore so it required (in illustrative terms) linking forward in time rather than back to the original dystopian aspects of the work which mean so much less now. \\n Illustrators often have problems with expressing sexual transgression when they move away from faux-realism. This novel hints at transgression (unlike later work) so those hints should have been more realistically 'glamorous'. \\n Perhaps not one of the great Moore works but still ahead of his then-contemporaries in the writing and an interesting cultural footnote. There is an insightful essay at the beginning from Moore.\"),\n",

Annie Savoy (Susan Sarandon) asks Millie how the sex was with Ebby Calvin LaLoosh (Tim Robbins), and Millie says, \"He kind of fucks like he throws, sorta all over the place.\" And that is EXACTLY how Neil Gaiman writes. \\n He has mad creative talent. There is no denying it. But too often that talent is uncontrolled, chaotic and even bafflingly silly. The Doll\\'s House, written back when he was just becoming Neil Gaiman (and probably had editors forcing his work to be more restrained, which is a scary thought), is packed full of brilliant stuff. \\n The \"cereal\" convention that turns out to be a convention of serial killers is wicked genius. The cast of characters who make up one of the titular Doll Houses -- Ken and Barbie, the Spider Women, flamboyant Hal, Sandman\\'s missing Fiddler\\'s Green (a landscape of mountains and rivers and foothills turned man), and Rose, the Vortex of Dream -- is fascinating and rich.

Scott Pilgrim\\'s Finest Hour is my least favorite volume in the series. \\n Before I get to this particular volume, let me say first that the whole Scott Pilgrim series is a very worthwhile read. There is nothing that is near it. The mashup of Japanese with western pop culture makes it unique. Bryan Lee O\\'Malley has definitely crafted a classic. The whole series is a four stars for me. \\n Now back with the final volume. The best I can say is that it is a fitting conclusion to this crazy story. If there\\'s one word that summarizes this particular book, it is maturity. But you see, that is my problem with volume six. This maturity theme takes so much fun away from the story. Everyone (except for Scott) sort of changed and moved on. The thing is, I just wanted a silly book about juveniles with all those hilarious pop culture references in music and gaming, getting crazy and lousy with love or perhaps their perception of it. I wasn\\'t ready for the unexpected serious undertones. The buildup towards the Gideon fight was full of exposition and self-realization, and I cringed reading those pages (that Nega Scott thing, the sabbatical wilderness stuff and the cryo-frozen fan-service anime girls Gideon has been collecting). The Saiyan Gideon inside Ramona\\'s mind, treating her like some BDSM material gave me very uncomfortable sensations. It is just waaaay off. \\n So to summarize what I have written so far: it is not that I hate this maturity thing in the final volume, it is just I do not want it in this material. Scott Pilgrim for me is meant to be an unadulterated guilty-pleasure graphic literature, free from preaching and the horrors of understanding what it is to be adults. \\n The biggest contradiction though is Scott Pilgrim getting on with Ramona Flowers! If Scott truly understood maturity, he would not have chosen Ramona IMHO. Hell, he could have been with Knives or Lisa, or even Kim! I guess it is the power of Backstreet Boys\\' \"As Long as You Love Me\" perception of love which prevailed, eh? \\n So again, let me be clear, the narration is solid, I just don\\'t like how it turned out to be. There were no disjointed panels like the ones I have mentioned in the previous volumes. Artwork is inconsistent in some pages, but this is a nitpick so it is not a big issue.

Happily, this shorter collection has not only the beginning, the middle, and the end of the crossover, but also feels entirely coherent. \\n I've been surprised that the event was received with such disregard. While Standoff isn't standout, this is s still a good story (though it's more a Captain America story than anything else). \\n Yeah, the premise is kind of wonky. Maria Hill gets an all-powerful reality-changing weapon, and uses it to create a prison for super-villains. But, I find it kind of believable in a superhero universe (even if the actually intent is confused even more in Captain America: Steve Rogers, Volume 1: Hail Hydra, which has flashbacks in issue #2, explaining some of what went on here). \\n And yeah, I totally don't understand why the prison failed, which would have been something good to actually explain. \\n But suspend your disbelief and put those issues aside, and this is a fun four issues. There's great interaction between the three Caps (Steve, Sam, and ex-Cap Bucky) and there's some major turning points for all three of them. It's what an event should be! \\n My only real complaint is that the fourth issue is a little weak, because first it focuses on a big fight (which is where most of the crossovers with other comics seem to occur) and then it drops into a lot of telling, now showing, for the denouement. \\n But overall, this is a fun event, running at least 3.5 stars, and drifting upward from there.\"),\n",

       "  'Peter Tomasi gets what makes a great Batman story. Yes, we love the fights and the intellectual side of the title character, but a great story is born of Batman\\'s emotional side, his passion. What happens when that passion is poisoned by grief at the death of his son? That question gives this book tremendous pathos and narrative heft. \\n One of the great themes that ran through the whole Damian story was that Batman may be good at everything -- but orphaned Bruce Wayne is pretty much a terrible father. Indeed, with his wards in the best stories, he\\'s not even much of a father figure. As a general, great. As a dad? Not so much. Perhaps I read to much here into Tomasi\\'s work, but I see that as the pervasive undercurrent in this book -- grief born of Bruce Wayne\\'s knowledge that he was never much of a parent during his time with his son, which was too brief. For me that also explains why Batman, who eschews bringing back his parents (though he was delirious when they appeared deus ex machina at times in the DC universe), will break his own rules to try and resurrect Damian. A bad parent, he\\'s a master strategist and genius problem solver. Supporting a son? No, but bringing him back from the dead is just another challenge. I loved his frantic efforts, especially the odd choice to seek out the aid of Frankenstein (let\\'s face it, when you are taking facts of life advice from the severed head of a reanimated Frankenstein, you must be pretty close to rock bottom). \\n One of the ironies of Batman is that for all of his \"Bat-Family,\" those other members much more support him then he the supposed patriarch supports them. He\\'s not their father. He\\'s their general. Some may complain about Batman\\'s selfish anger when his \"family\" tries to comfort him, but that is par for the course. Batman has always served as an outlet for an emotionally stunted Bruce Wayne. How else to explain that, rather than somehow explaining his son\\'s demise, Bruce decides to create an elaborate fantasy about Damian being \"sent abroad\"? It isn\\'t just about his desire to bring him back from the dead -- it is a desire to deny reality. \\n A few other points really stand out in this series. Batman seeking out Jason Todd just pulsates with conflict and near madness (just as it reminds up that, in world where Bucky and Todd come back, what\\'s to keep Damian dead?). Others may complain about Carrie Kelly\\'s appearance, but I thought it offered a lot of potential, as well as showing us that the Damian we readers knew, wasn\\'t the whole of this complicated conflicted character. Lastly, as Tomasi does so well, Alfred even if he remains in the background, comes to this book fully realized and fully alive. \\n That said, I must remove a star for DC\\'s inexplicable decision not to have Patrick Gleason draw this entire book. His replacement produces fine yeoman images, but Gleason\\'s work captures Batman like few others can. He doesn\\'t have to draw every Batman book, but changing midstream? That just damages a book. \\n Despite this poor artistic choice by DC, this is sure to be one of the superhero books of the year. An ARC was provided through Netgalleys in exchange for an honest review.'),\n",

My other favourite work by her is Pureblood + Boyfriend a. I'll cover it some other time. Okay, now let's get back to the story \\n Why I loved this series so much that I even re-read it 3 times and also fourth time to cover it ere? The answer is pretty simple. First of all, the entire plot is pretty interesting with the whole main protagonist's heart being stolen and all that jazz... second? Heh, this is my favourite - lots of bishies. Oh I guess you may not know what a bishie is. Hot looking guy in plain words, but doesn't bishie sound more fun? You get drool over any guy there, maybe except Azusa, but that was only for me, who know maybe you'll like him the most. \\n The person who makes you droll a lot and at the same time frustrates you even more is Cain - the student council president. From eh very first pages he just makes an entrance as the bad guy, and it would have sticked perfectly to him if we are not shown his good sides throughout the story. I think the guy didn't even understand why he wanted to monopolize Hiyoki in the very beginning. Pathetic as it seems, he makes an amazing character and fan girl material for a long time. \\n The story catches your interest from the very beginning with a unique idea. Okay, the harem is not that new, but how Hiyoki ended up in the harem, that's what was interesting. Shouoto sensei doesn't disappoint in the fantasy and mystery division. She brings to life so many interesting ideas and no matter what kind of hypothesis you try to conclude she just takes and breaks all stereotypes as a will as your ideas, presenting something absolutely new and interesting. \\n I hope you'll find some time to read this great story. Set yourself with Hiyoki on a journey to retrieve her heart and have fun in a world of hot guys. There are only 20 chapters, but every one of those is full of secrets that wait for you to unravel them. Enjoy it to its fullest and don't forget to share your thoughts below.\"),\n",

       "  'We\\'re told or reminded at the beginning of each issue -- by an ant chorus -- that Eric O\\'Grady, S.H.I.E.L.D. surveillance nobody, is a jerk. We\\'re told over and over again what a \"bad guy\" he is, what a douchebag, what an asshole. \\n What does it take to become a bad-douche-hole? \\n 1. Lie to people to get them in bed with you. \\n 2. Lie about a friend\\'s relationship to pry him/her away from a person you dig. \\n 3. Steal something off their dead body. \\n 4. Lie to score a free dinner. \\n 5. Peep at some naked folks (a dozen or so at different times) in the shower. \\n 6. Sleeping with the dead friends lover in the dead friend\\'s bed. \\n 7. Being party to an unplanned pregnancy. \\n 8. Indetectable stalking. \\n And, yes, O\\'Grady commits all the transgressions on that list, but what is so fascinating about this tale is that O\\'Grady isn\\'t even close to a super-villain. He\\'s amoral, perhaps, but not particularly immoral -- which makes him a much mroe realistic character than your average Marvel super-hero -- and Walking Dead creator, Robert Kirkman offers plenty of subtle detail to allow us empathize with O\\'Grady if we so choose. \\n O\\'Grady, you see, is always being treated poorly by everyone around him, oftentimes undeservedly and bafflingly. He\\'s treated like a side-kick by his friend Chris (the guy everyone likes, who just happens to be the original thief of the Ant-Man suit, which doesn\\'t seem to bother anyone); he\\'s bullied by Mitch Carson, a belligerent asshole of a S.H.I.E.L.D. security officer, who treats O\\'Grady like shit at every turn. \\n As for the list: O\\'Grady\\'s ignorant to the fact that he\\'s made a baby with Veronica (by the end of this volume) because she wasn\\'t able to get him alone to tell him, and speaking of Veronica, he was the one initially interested in her, and Chris, Mr. Goldenboy, went behind his back to strike up a relationship with her; O\\'Grady\\'s initial moment of shower peeping (although there\\'s no excuse for his second round of voyeurism) and the stalking of Ms. Marvel are entirely by accident; if he hadn\\'t stolen the Ant-Man armor he\\'d have been dead at the hands of HYDRA; and the free dinner he pried out of a woman only came after he saved her from a pair of muggers. \\n Now I am not saying that he\\'s a good guy or even a nice guy, but he\\'s not a monster either. Hell, even after taking a savage beating at the hands of Carson (the nastiest person in the comic, in my opinion) and needing badly to escape the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier, O\\'Grady, having accidently burned off half of Carson\\'s face, saves the man\\'s life by taking him to the infirmary and puts himself in serious jeopardy. \\n He\\'s no Captain America. But he\\'s no En Sabah Nur either. He\\'s a just a man, a rather regular man, flawed, mostly selfish, poorly treated, treating others poorly, who stumbles on a suit and winds up with powers that make his life easier. What he does with those powers is, I think, what a whole bunch of people would actually do. I\\'m glad Kirkman took us into the life of Eric O\\'Grady. His mediocrity makes him one of the more interesting super-characters I\\'ve ever encountered.'),\n",

       "  'In the great debate regarding DC\\'s decision to launch \"Before Watchmen,\" I remain committedly agnostic. I understand the view of those who see Moore and Gibson\\'s creations as unique, not only for their place in the evolution of the comic as an art form but also, perhaps, as characters meant to occupy a singular storyline and go no further. And yes, one should understandably fear the possibility - hyperbole intentional - of these stories feeling like \"Hamlet - the Prequel.\" At the same time, characters passing from one creative team to another lays at the very DNA of superhero comics, part of what makes it a form unlike any other. After all, Moore and Gibson originally imagined their story populated by the Charlton Comics\\' characters (The Question, Blue Beatle, Captain Atom, etc) before deciding on creating a cast all their own. Just as Gaiman \"adopted\" the New Gods and made something new and exciting, and Kirby and Shuster\\'s Captain America passed into Brubaker\\'s loving hands, should The Minutemen be any different? \\n So how is \"Before Watchmen: Nite Owl & Dr. Manhattan\"? Not as bad as many feared, but given the talent of those involved, probably not as good as it should have been. Indeed, of the \"Before Watchmen\" books, no other so combines the good and the bad of the effort. \\n Nite Owl certainly represents the bad. Michael Straczynski, usually one of my favorite comic writers for his excellent dialogue and bright characterizations here mostly just seems to phone in a prequel/origin story. Wealthy Daniel Drieberg\\'s motivations for donning the cowl read like boiler plate serial stuff. His early days being trained by the original Nite Owl have a similar sense of having \"been there, done that.\" In terms of the one bit of new character insight that the book does deliver... well, if you\\'ve spent the last few decades wondering as to the why of Daniel\\'s particular and peculiar sexual dysfunction, this is your lucky day! Question answered. Perhaps I speak for no other readers, but I\\'d really have preferred a story that mined the rich vein of Nite Owl and Roarschach\\'s complex relationship. \\n On the flip side, Dr. Manhattan represents some of the best and most original storytelling in this whole endeavor. Strazinski here embraces the constraints writing a prequel, shining a whole new light on a story that we saw in the original book, Dr. Manhattan\\'s origin. Here we see it conceived of, not as an unalterable linear path, but as a series of decisions, each of which could have taken the good doctor into a far different life. (A note here: some will object at liberties taken, since in the original story Manhattan embraced determinism and explained that he has no choice, that none of us do, and that the only difference between his god-like power and we ants is that he \"can see the strings.\" To those who feel the need to wail and froth about this writerly choice, I say get over yourself). Dr. Manhattan\\'s choices are often interesting and usually inspired by the most quotidian of motivations (and you thought the world was saved before because the good doctor had a weakness for jail bait?!). Would we have liked Dr. Jon Osterman? Could it be that he had as much potential as a mere human as he did as a near-god? Could the whole Watchmen universe really begin at the series end? \\n By the by, Adam Hughes\\' art work serves this particular series quite well. His style, so smooth and seemingly effortless, harkens back to much of the beauty in Gibbons\\' original while still making it wholly his own. And of course, while I could of course do with fewer giant blue shlong levitating about, Hughes doesn\\'t, um, overwork the image. \\n These various \"splits\" as the story branches as decision points give the reader a wonderful insight into Dr. Manhattan\\'s essential humanity. That humanity, so crucial to Watchmen\\'s plot, just delights here. And so we get thoughts of loss. Questions of what it means to be human. A wonderful examination of the profound prison that is loneliness. Still more fun, one can spot any number of interesting Freudian Easter Eggs that seek to deepen the meaning of otherwise minor points in Moore and Gibson\\'s original. I especially liked Dr. Manhattan\\'s interactions with the world\\'s smartest man, Ozymandias (no more significant that \"the world\\'s smartest ant). This scene as much as any in the whole of this project served to enrich the larger Watchmen universe. \\n As with other of the Watchmen collections, this one includes a shorter back up story, in this case the two-issue \"Moloch.\" For those who don\\'t recall, Moloch serves as the catch all super-villain in the Watchmen universe. He wasn\\'t all that interesting in the Moore/Gibson original, save in that he demonstrated that age could render villains every bit as pathetic as any hero. As with Nite Owl, this book leaves one wondering whether it needed to exist at all. We get a lot of back story, answering questions we probably didn\\'t need answered. In the current default origin story for comic villains, we learn that Moloch\\'s background was tragic and that we should feel sorry for him. All that said, this story does contain a few bright lights. As with Dr. Manhattan, Straczynski again demonstrates a flair for writing Ozymandias, one which makes me wish he\\'d been given that book (see my review). Moloch and Ozymandias\\'s interactions deepen both characters, giving the former some much needed agency and making the latter still creepier (making Ozymandias creepier seems to be a major theme running through much of Before Watchmen). Eduardo Risso\\'s art also fits this story beautifully, Risso\\'s style and muted colors exuding a certain neo-gothic feel that evokes dark fairytales. \\n While not the best \"Before Watchmen\" chapter, \"Nite Owl & Dr. Midnight\" mostly holds its own and certainly isn\\'t the worst. Still, as with much of this enterprise, this book is just a sad shadow of what might have been.'),\n",

I can\\'t believe it\\'s been gone for 16 years now. Your precocious Calvin was what every kid with an overactive imagination is in their own heads, but you also gave us the view of what the rest of the world sees in these kids and does to try and beat the imagination out of them. There\\'s implied sadness in the explicit joy you gave us, and it makes Calvin and Hobbes a true masterpiece. \\n I was fourteen when you started your opus, and I was close enough to my own hyper-imaginative childhood to connect at a visceral level. My youthful imaginary friends were still fresh in my mind, and my current imaginary friends were just taking hold, and your strip gave me something to relate to, someone to cheer for, a place where it was okay to turn dreary realties of the world into exciting fantasies and be proud of that ability all at the same time.

I want to see where Calvin is now. I want to see Calvin as a Dad, and I want his son (or daughter) with a beaten up, super ratty, devilish-as-ever Hobbes. But I don\\'t want this comic to be about the kids, I want it to be about Calvin. I want to see how well Calvin was able to fight off his indoctrination; I imagine he\\'s one of those rare folks who didn\\'t join the mainstream, who somehow continued to live on his own terms, but my imagination aside, I am dying to see what he became for you. Please, please, please come back, Bill. We could all use a bit of Calvin again. \\n I know that my request will never reach you, and that, if it did, you\\'d probably never even consider the possibility, but I know you could do the \"parenting thing\" better than all your peers, just as you did the \"kid thing\" better than anyone else. \\n So I\\'ll just leave you with the firmest, most heartfelt thank you that I have in me: thank you for that little corner of joy you carved into my world. I\\'ll never forget it, and late at night, when I am dipping my peanut butter and jelly into my hot chocolate, I\\'ll have one of my Calvin and Hobbes books open so that I can stain the pages with the purple of some yummy Welch\\'s grape jelly.

Worlds like this are worlds of the human imagination: their reality, or lack of reality, is not important. What is important is that they are there. These worlds provide an alternative.

Grant Morrison\\'s story is fun just because it imagines a totally weird SF idea [8/10]. \\n Keepsake (140). This story is really shallow, but fun for how it shows the Doctor being both silly (like the early 7) and also manipulating someone into doing something for him (like the late 7) [6/10]. \\n Planet of the Dead (141-142). So this story has old companions and old Doctors, introduced for the purpose of an anniversary, but used really, really shallowly. Despite that, it\\'s fun, especially in the interactions between the Doctors, which is spot on. The relation to the history of the Whifferdils is fun too [7/10]. \\n Echoes of the Morgor! (143-144). Nice to have Abnett writing a story. This one is as thin as most of the stories in this volume, but still offers up an interesting mystery that\\'s fun to read. However the old memories imprinted on crystals feels very overused, especially since it appeared in the \"Dragonsfire\" episode right around the same time [6/10]. \\n Overall, there\\'s not a lot that stands out here, but some of it was worth reading.'),\n",

       "  'see full review @ Katie\\'s Corner \\n Today I have another work by Hwang Mi-Ri. Yep, it\\'s one of those, which I read while interested in the author. This one as always drew me in with its title. I thought it would be similar to either Love So Life or at least Penguin Love. But even though it was about raising kids it had many other interesting ideas woven into it. One surely was teenage pregnancy and another was solely dedicated to family issue. To say the truth the kid does appear but we do not really see him, though in the latest chapters, he\\'s been appearing more and more and actually playing his role of a matchmaker. \\n I believe the one of the main themes that the author stresses is family issue. There are two types of families, one the girl\\'s family made me sick to the core, they were using their kid to gain money. There are many moments when I flipped and screamed at my tablet. I wish no one to experience the same feelings and attitude that the girl received. Her own family didn\\'t help her, when her son was dying and why is that, because the results said that it was not the rich guy\\'s kid. I just wanted to become a character for a minute and just give them a beating. And as soon as the results in their favour came they again remembered that it was their grandkid. \\n On the other hand we have the guy\\'s family. The only normal person was grandfather, others? I just wanted to mince them. I mean, I get it you didn\\'t want such a daughter-in-law, but come on, that baby us your kid\\'s child. At least treat him nice. And if you want to make the mother leave, try something else, but not bullying. Mother was someone that just ticked me off as soon as she appears. She was also the one who came into the family and she was holding herself as f she was born there. I knew she would try to turn the girl into a maid as soon as the grandfather left, but actually saying that her cooking sucked, just die. \\n Now some words about the father of the kid. Well, he acts like an absolute jerk, though he\\'s developing some feelings towards the mother. They\\'re still in progress and there have been new chapters coming out lately, meaning we will see some development soon. Well, he grew like a character and a person in my eyes when he shouted at noona for not looking at his kid. At least the guy had balls to shout like that at the girl he\\'s in love with. But now let me talk a bit about the main character - the mother of the kid. I think she\\'s the best character there. Even though was on her side all the time, sometimes her naivety killed me. But at the same time she did have her own opinion and if we can say thus, the girl had balls. When she forbade her \"husband\" to come near their kid after an accident, I was proud of her. To say the truth she is the most pitiable character there, however, in the latest chapters, when more people warm up to her, she is getting better. I remember at one point, I just shouted at her saying that it would have been better of she took all her money, went to another city and lived happily with her kid alone. I mean, I would have doe that I her place, no one really was happy with her. \\n Well, I\\'m off to wait for new chapters. I hope you\\'ll take it up. You will enjoy it for its complexity and many read like issues that the author stresses. Enjoy it to its fullest and don\\'t forget to share your thought below! Stay tuned for more reviews as well as promos. Don\\'t miss your next favourite book or manga. Happy reading! \\n XOXO \\n Katie'),\n",

       "  'Ms. Marvel Team-Up (ASM 7-8). Hey what!? Two totally unrelated issues about a Ms. Marvel Team-Up! Here\\'s the problem with super team-ups meant to swell the media profile of a newbie: most writers only know how to write that as a big fight. And that\\'s what we get here. Mind you, Slott pushes all the right buttons, even making it relevant to current events in the Marvel universe through an Inhuman pod connection ... but it\\'s just a big fight. A pity, as there\\'s other great material in these issues about Peter\\'s position in the world. It just gets the vast minority of the time [6/10]. \\n The Edge of Spider-Verse \\n Superior Spider-Man (SS 32-33). Some Diver Dude is murdering multiversal Spiders. It was confusing after seeing Morlun in the FCBD intro. More generally, I feel like this was just a total waste of these two bonus issues of Superior. It\\'s great to see Otto being the one who gets the band together, but otherwise these issues are a dull waste. \\n Spider-Man 2099 5. Nice to see that Miguel is mixed up in all this too. Mind you, this is more of the S-V murder-fest, but at least it offers some perspective. \\n The Shorts. Here we get piles of Spiders and sometimes Morlun murdering spiders. Slott\\'s stories are the best of the pack, because he does a great job of really personifying multiversal Spider-Man and creating emotional beats as they die. However, it\\'s hard to get behind a murderfest, no matter how well executed, and the stories of all the spiders get a little mind-numbing. The Team-Up stories were also interesting because we finally started to get some continuity amidst the shorts. (And the Edge of Spider-Verse mini-series should have been in here because it\\'s intertwined with many of these stories.). \\n The Spider-Verse \\n I think that Slott is never at his best with these big mega-crossovers, because they sacrifice the character and the small moments that he really excels at. Still, this is a fun story for all its varied spider-men. \\n Of the crossover series, The Scarlet Spiders is the best, because it\\'s got a nice beginning and end. Spider-Man 2099 is OK, if a bit too focused on its own continuity at times, but it still has some nice conclusions that wrap back into the main series. Shockingly, Spider-Woman was the most troubled of the crossovers, in large part because it kept losing its focus. Spider-Woman jumped from mission to mission without rhyme or reason (or closure) and the other Spider-Women kept entering and exiting the picture; it was a mess, and overall I suspect these four incoherent issues did damage to the new Spider-Woman comic \\n As a whole, Spider-Verse was too much of a good thing. It had a good central idea and it spun wildly out of control with too many setup issues and too many crossovers, and too much chaos amidst it all. It was memorable, I suppose, but as a massive action event it just barely earns 3.5 stars. \\n Structurally, I wish Marvel were better at organizing these event omnibuses. Like the last few, here they don\\'t take advantage of having all the issues together, but instead segregate each of the individual series. And, I felt it was important to read things in order here, because characters drifted in and out of the crossovers in ways that were relevant. At least we get a chronological listing at the start if you want to read it in actual order ... but without a numbered table of contents, it\\'s still tricky! \\n Oh, and the other structural issue was those missing 5 issues of \"Edge of Spider-Verse\". Why would you have a complete event but leave out 5 issues that closely tie to (and in some cases between) the rest of the stories? Weird. \\n All these structural issues were enough to drop my 3.5 stars to a 3.'),\n",

       "  '\"Miyazaki\\'s films are also striking for their preoccupation with the environment.\"-- \\n Margaret Talbot, The New Yorker, January 7, 2005. \\n Dear Ms. Talbot, \\n If I may disturb you for a few minutes from your entertaining writing about the personal quirks and predilections of celebrities and oddballs, I would like to inform you of a few facts known to me as a student of the history and culture of Japan and having lived in Japan for the better part of a quarter of a century. \\n First of all, please note that the primary religion of the Japanese is Shinto, a fact that may not have been mentioned in the in-flight magazine during your flight over. Shinto holds that the world is filled with spirits, which inhabit every aspect of nature. Shinto shrines are spread throughout Japan invariably in natural, often remote, settings, and can be dedicated to the worship of woodland creatures, rock formations, waterfalls, large, ancient trees, hills, valleys, mountains and forests large and small. The belief that spirits are inherent in these natural phenomena is also seen in traditional Japanese children\\'s stories which are loaded with animals and spirits who rescue the weak and downtrodden, deliver justice to the powerful or simply create general nuisances. This belief in the anima of nature is not moribund. Just one month ago I attended my son\\'s kindergarten end of year ceremony where the only song sung was addressed to a 120 year old cherry tree in the school garden. \\n Though you may not have noticed during your brief sojourn here to interview the hermit-like director, Hayao Miyazaki, it is nearly common knowledge that the Japanese archipelago is home to numerous active volcanos and frequently shaken by devastating earthquakes. These represent natural environmental phenomena which some believe to be of supernatural origin. After the March 2011 earthquake which killed more than 30,000, the mayor of Tokyo warned it was a form of divine reproach. \\n The Japanese diet, which sustains them, consists primarily of grains, vegetables, fruits, fish and meat, all of which are part of the natural environment. The Japanese are obsessed with the preparation, taste and appreciation of nature\\'s bounty. Even lowly diner cooks are artisans, and processed foods are frowned on. \\n Weather, which nourishes the food, also brings devastating disasters, in the form of typhoons, mudslides and floods, and is paid close attention on a daily basis. \\n While you had no way to learn this in the hour drive from Narita Airport to your hotel in downtown Tokyo, the Japanese are well known to be admirers of the sunrise, the colors of the evening sky, all the phases of the moon and all manner of flowers and grasses, and are keen observers of the passing seasons, frequently composing poems about flowers, plants and the seasons and their feelings when experiencing them. That this predilection runs deep in their culture might be gathered by selected readings from The Tale of Genji or The Pillow Book, two works thought to be among the first writings by women in the history of literature. This tradition of paying due attention to one\\'s natural surroundings continued on down through Japan\\'s feudal era, exemplified by the famed Haiku poet Basho and others, and into the modern era, with the poet Takuboku Ishikawa, for example, whose most famous poem is an ode to the mountains of his home village. \\n In addition, although these places were probably not at the top of your list of Japanese tourist attractions worth a peek, in the summer of 1945, thousands of Japanese women, children, elderly and other non-combatants were killed nearly instantaneously when nuclear fission explosions suddenly occurred over the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The resulting radiation sickened and killed thousands more in the months and years afterwards. The process of nuclear fission and resultant radiation was thought by the Japanese to represent an aspect of the natural environment, albeit an aspect that had been twisted by humans in a way that went against the law of the natural world. This singular event of horror became a lesson burned into the minds of many Japanese about the prideful manipulation of the natural environment by humanity. As you may know, in the postwar years a metaphorical story was told of how nature rose up, in the form of a horrible giant reptile, Godzilla, and other awful sleeping monsters, and laid waste to Tokyo and other major Japanese cities. \\n In reality, during the three decades of rapid economic growth from the 1950s through the 1970s, many Japanese throughout the islands were sickened and even killed by industrial pollution of the air and water. This degradation by humans of the air and water included the disfiguring and lethal industrial mercury poisoning around Minamata City in Kyushu and the deadly air pollution in Yokkaichi City south of Tokyo. Japan\\'s environmental movement grew in reaction to the human costs of environmental damage caused by industrial growth. I will not do more than mention the shock of the recent Fukushima meltdown, which, in any case, post-dates your article. \\n Thus, given their culture, history and present circumstances, it should be understandable to someone of your perception how the Japanese and Mr. Miyazaki, in particular, could justifiably believe that humanity\\'s fate is linked to the natural environment, and perhaps also determined by it. Nevertheless, Ms. Talbot, you seem a bit put off by this \"preoccupation,\" as you put it, with the environment. It appears to strike you as odd, dare I say, unnatural. \\n Perhaps I am reading too much into your brief aside. Perhaps you are merely alluding to the fact that Miyazaki goes beyond the traditional romance and human conflict stories in his story telling. While the human conflict and romance is there, Ghibili Studio stories frequently get behind the human story, and bring in a second, underlying story, a bigger story, of the conflict between the pride of man and the natural environment. \\n In this respect, Miyazaki\\'s movies are studies in unintended consequences. \\n Is this theme not familiar to you, Ms. Talbot? Is there not a long line of western stories that follow this theme, of humanity overstepping its boundaries and getting into serious trouble? Beginning with the stories of the Tower of Babel and the Flood, where humanity, too big for its britches, is taken down a notch by the Creator, and in Greek tales of youth becoming fatally enamored with new technology, this theme of come-uppance is reflected in one man\\'s deal with the devil told by Goethe and others, and in 18th century tales of doctors experimenting with chemical enhancements unthinkingly turning themselves into criminal brutes (Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde; The Invisible Man), or a brilliant chemist striving to create life who ends up creating a monster that goes on a murderous rampage which includes its creator\\'s family (Frankenstein), and, in the late 20th century a story about government scientists creating a virus that destroys civilization (The Stand), and a series of movies about advances in computer and robotic development bringing about the singularity that destroys civilization (The Terminator). \\n These fictional doomsday scenarios did not appear from nowhere, they are not cut from whole cloth. Like the atomic age that spurred the Godzilla metaphor, there are real scientific developments underpinning them. A book that helped give rise to the environmental movement in the United States was written by a biologist who died of cancer shortly after its publication in 1962 (Silent Spring). The deleterious impact of industrial production on our biological environment has been documented innumerable times since, including in The End of Nature by Bill McKibben. Professors Joseph A. Tainter and Jared Diamond have written about the collapse of various civilizations that failed to regulate their interaction with the environment. Humanity may be putting itself at risk of self-extermination by overstepping, and possibly by merely continuing on its current path. \\n Characterizing these scenarios as alarmist, or exaggerations, may have been in fashion at one point in time. It may have been profitable. It probably still is. However, the increasing burden of CO2 in our atmosphere, the more than half century trend in global annual temperatures, and the power of our current sciences, should be at the very least a cause for concern among perceptive individuals. \\n The movies of Hayao Miyazaki, as you have observed, are more than merely preoccupied with the environment. Miyazaki posits a very Japanese faith in the ultimate supremacy of the environment. In his stories, nature is important, and the significance of nature is that it ultimately rescues humanity from its own folly. Gaia provides the restart button when the program of humanity crashes. \\n From your statement above, one can guess that you, a denizen of New York and Los Angeles, cities built on the extraction, manipulation and exploitation of the natural environment of the North American continent and well-being of divers of its erstwhile inhabitants, who likely frequents the popular restaurants, who has no doubt read many books, who probably tries to get to the beach in the summer time, and who undoubtedly has the utmost respect for the right kind of people, are not unduly \"preoccupied\" with the environment, and perhaps feel entertainment that depicts, and causes thoughts about, possible unpleasant future scenarios is inappropriate to our time, and perhaps even in bad taste. \\n I believe that Hayao Miyazaki, Jared Diamond, Joseph A. Tainter and Rachel Carson, were she alive today, among many, many others, would join me in wishing you the best of luck with that, Ms. Talbot. \\n Sincerely, \\n A Concerned Citizen'),\n",

She kidnaps WW\\'s boyfriend, raises WW\\'s Mom from Hades and pits daughter against mother, aims a nuclear bomb at a portal to Themyscira, brings war to Washington DC, and generally makes a real nuisance of herself. \\n Picoult seems too bound by the rules of the DC Universe and WW\\'s ethics, so that nothing interesting really comes out of the story -- although she gives it a solid effort. \\n There is too much cheesy banter for my taste, particularly between Nemesis and WW, and there is too much violence from WW directed at Nemesis, which we are supposed to believe is cute (but it isn\\'t). The story also ends with a fairly deftly handled but still gratingly cliche moment of sacrifice. \\n Picoult does a decent job within the limits she is set, and I saw enough in Love and Murder to actually make me consider reading one of Picoult\\'s novels (any suggestions would be appreciated), but this particular graphic novel (which I suspect was really a cycle within the WW series proper) didn\\'t excite me at all. \\n Too bad too, \\'cause I rally wanted to be excited.'),\n",

The Eighth Doctor is clearly energetic and larger-than-life, but we get very little feel for him other than that ... and new companion Izzy comes across much the same. (And she\\'s adopted, eh? There\\'s no chance that\\'ll come up some time in the future ...) [7/10]. \\n The Keep (248-249). A nice little bit of SF, though it\\'s more SF than Doctor Who.

Oh, and the return of the Threshold, stars of the story that must not be spoken of (\"Ground Zero\", the story where DWM purposefully broke chronology with the Virgin New Adventures by \"killing\" Ace). I suppose they\\'re a nice-enough antagonist if you ignore their horrible intro at the end of Seven\\'s run. \\n Overall, I love the plots and machinations of this adventure, but I also love what it reveals about the DWM comic at the time: that it was flying by the seat of its past, interweaving storylines without knowing where it was going. It\\'s like the DWM of old ... and a contrast to the more soulless storylines of the modern-day, where links are carefully made at the end of each arc. Finally, I found Izzy increasingly likable in this story, as her irreverent pop-culture nature comes through more. All around, a great storyline [8/10]. \\n Tooth and Claw (257-260). A nice story that features the mystery and horror genres. It gets a little over-the-top at the end, and the characters are a little hard to keep track of, but this is still a well-told and original story [7/10]. \\n The Final Chapter (262-265). Nice to return to Gallifrey and encounter not only Rassilhon but his DWM agent, Shayde, as well. Part of why these 8th Doctor comics were good was the constant references to the DWM continuity. The actual plot with self-made clones feels a little too close to Lungbarrow to be comfortable -- in part because it continues to be so insistent about ignoring Virgin continuity. Nonetheless, this is a fun story, with its touchbacks to the origins of Gallifreyan society. It was surprising to have Fey continue over as a second companion, a bit more competent than Izzy. And the 8th Doctor\\'s regeneration at the end is of course shocking [6+/10]. \\n Wormwood (266-271). A nice conclusion to various arcs running back to the last Seventh Doctor story (which we do not speak of). It\\'s really helped by the fact that it feels like such an organic combination of continuing elements, something that is confirmed in the author\\'s notes at the back. The regeneration was of course a fake-out, a trick that DWM only gets to play once. As a result, we don\\'t get a lot of the Doctor in this arc (and I actually feel like I have a better idea of who the Fake Nine was than Eight). Anywho, we get a delightful origin for the Threshold, delightful relations to Gallifrey history (with the whole ancient-weapon gone wrong being a recurring trope in the New Adventures), and great use of Shayde connecting to all of that. Seeing Izzy with Ace\\'s bat suggested she still needs to grow some as a character, while it was sad to see Fey leave so quickly (but the new combined Fey/Shade seems even more interesting). Overall, a delightful piece that really feels like the slightly warped, slightly over-the-top world of the comic strip. [7/10]. \\n The volume ends with the out-of-order inclusion of a couple of one-offs: \\n A Matter of Life & Death (250). An excuse to bring in lots of old characters (sort of) for the mag\\'s 250th anniversary. Cute, but nothing there [5+/10]. \\n By Hook or By Crook (256). A fun little story that gives Izzy (and time travel) the ability to shine.

The writing was easy to follow with an action packed storyline. For a newcomer, it nicely introduces characters like Iron Fist, Jessica Jones, Moon Knight and others. I particularly liked the Punisher's introduction but with an alternate origin story for him. \\n An engaging read, lending another dimension to the Marvel Universe. Given that there will be a Netflix series featuring Luke Cage, Jessica Jones and others, I'm really excited to see how this translates to the small screen. If the Daredevil series is anything to go by, fans and non-fans will have more to cheer for!\"),\n",

       "  'see full review @ Katie\\'s Corner \\n \\'ve covered some time ago her another work, called \"My master is a demon\", if you want to you can read the review here. But let me get back to today\\'s manga. Why did I even reread the whole thing before writing review? And that\\'s with me having read the story roughly 4 times, maybe even more? Well, I didn\\'t want to miss anything wanted the review to be as full as I could even make it, while it\\'s still being translated to English. And while I\\'m writing, I\\'m basically covering only 9 volumes. There are 11 volumes in total if I am not mistaken. \\n See this faces? Aren\\'t they just awesome? \\n Why is this story s interesting? Well, the art is amazing that\\'s the first thing, but the whole thing is moving around special investigating police department, meaning many interesting cases, and oh, did I forgot to mention some supernatural things going around there? I did, didn\\'t I? Well, you have half the picture now. Why only half? Heh, add to that whole mix a gorgeous 17 year old Fuyuki with supernatural powers and a 26 year old handsome Kuze, and you\\'ll get 4/5 of the whole story. Interested? I advise you to be, because this story is exceptional in everything. The way characters interact, the cases they have to solve, the atmosphere around them. Just remembering, makes my blood boil with excitement and that\\'s a rare thing to happen to me. \\n Each chapter is a separate case, well, sometimes two or three chapters make one case, but you can\\'t say that the story progresses too slow. It progresses pretty fast and even if you do mot see it, trust me it\\'s there. The small gestures, some words and phrases make the relationship between Fuyuki and Kuze move into the right direction. And right now, Fuyuki\\'s idiocy is keeping her from completely understand Kuze\\'s words. Which in the beginning you\\'ll think that Fuyuki is the more straightforward one, it appears to be actually Kuze. Well, he is much older, so that maybe the reason too. His true intentions could be seen from end of the 1st volume, while Fuyuki understand her feelings only somewhere in 3rd or 4th volume. And from that time you\\'re really supporting them, shouting j: \"just confess normally, stop with the indirect things!\" that might frustrate you sometimes, but focus immediately inn other things, such as different cases and the characters themselves. \\n Fuyuki and Kuze, as always not paying attention to anyone! \\n Each character has a story to tell, not everything is yet revealed. So I don\\'t know for sure I might make a mini review when I finish reading the manga. There are may moments that crack you up, especially Fuyuki\\'s innocence and Kuze\\'s teasing. Those are just the best. The moment you start reading this manga. You just can\\'t make yourself put it down. It doesn\\'t matter if you have already read it once, you\\'ll still fund other stuff, which will suck you into it. \\n I hope you\\'ll get some time to read this manga. You\\'ll lose it for everything that it can show you. Enjoy every moment of it and don\\'t forget to share your thoughts below!

But once I did get into it, which probably happend after one or two issues, I absolutely loved it and flew through it. This might be one of my favorite comic collections so far.

Viewers are let in on what happened with the event, and the scary wytches are still after the daughter. \\n I really quite liked this book overall, though I really didn\\'t believe the motivation of the mother to pledge her daughter. Especially when she thought it was what the husband wanted. Some mom she is... The monsters, were weird and scary. That they were allegedly alternate evolved creatures from neanderthals was kind of stupid, especially that their eyes were on the side of their head and they were mysteriously exceptionally adept at natural science was ridiculous. Still didn\\'t take away from enjoying the story a lot. \\n The art was a bit of a mix. The pencils/illustration was really good. I liked them a lot. The color wash splashes were sometimes alright, sometimes a bit much. They got more frequent as the creepiness set in further. I think that they obscured the view was intentional, as we always find things more frightening when we can fill in the gaps with our imagination. Sometimes they just got irritating though. Colors besides that were pretty good. \\n I\\'m not sure why this is listed as Vol 1 when it\\'s the only one. I kind of wish there were more though. \\n Forgot to mention a story: Shortly after reading this, actually very shortly - I finished reading this about 1am in bed one night. Like I said, it\\'s a pretty creepy book. Went to sleep and about an hour later I woke up to a figure standing next to my bed over me (sorta). In my grogginess I realized it was my 9 year old son. He didn\\'t tap me or say anything (that I\\'m aware of), he just stood there looking at me and I woke up. Freaky enough on it\\'s own. Then he says he\\'s really scared. I figure ah just a bad dream or whatever, no big deal. He had to go downstairs to pee and wanted my bravery to go with him. Then he says he saw some large creature in the dark and it said \"I see you looking at me with those little eyes\" in a creepy voice. Ok, there goes my bravery. House is dark and he\\'s slinking behind me and I\\'m trying to be the fearless dad, but I\\'m checking every dark corner and peeking around walls as we go.

Focussing on one particular theory that has since been discredited, Alan Moore's graphic novel From Hell provides a complex, politically intense, gory mystery perfect for any late Halloween night. But lacklustre art significantly lowers the enjoyment of this particular read. \\n The story is based on the Whitechapel murders of 1888, better known as the Jack the Ripper case. If you're unfamiliar, a serial killer murdered five impoverished prostitutes, luring them in with grapes (a delicacy at the time) before slashing their throats and mutilating them after death. Theories and suspects were numerous, but none were ever confirmed and the killer was never caught. \\n If all that sounds familiar, then you might have watched the 2001 movie From Hell starring Johnny Depp, which was based on this comic series. But believe me: the graphic novel is quite a bit different and far better. The main difference is that the story focusses more on the Ripper himself, rather than the romance or investigation. \\n The art by Eddie Campbell was the only problem I had with this book. I wanted more than anything to see the grit and darkness that is so synonymous with this legend. Instead I got pen scribbles in the vague shape of a face, and panels where the foreground and background are oftentimes impossible to distinguish from one another. \\n I rarely ever say this, but this is one graphic novel where I hope to find a literary adaptation.

The result is entirely enjoyable, with a great cast of characters, and terrific artwork (also by Cooke). However, Cooke really *nails* the ending, which is superb. [7/10] \\n Trail of the Catwoman. In previously reading Selina's Big Score, it always felt like Slam Bradley's part of the story was incomplete.

Though the actual story is somewhat pedestrian, it offers up a great new direction for Selina, as the protector of those whom no one else protects -- and it does so while also making sense of her many ups, downs, and other changes in direction. I'm also hopeful for the new supporting cast that's being put together. Oh, and this issue has some great art! [7/10]. \\n Trickle Down Theory (5).

This feels like the strongest arc of Brubaker's new Catwoman book to date. We've got Selina dealing with morally questionable situations, a great supporting cast, and connections to Gotham Central. All around a great story that also looks like it's building up to something good, with its continuing expansion of the who's-the-villain game [8/10]. \\n On the whole, this is no Gotham Central (yet?), but it's an enjoyable companion piece by some of the same hands.\"),\n",

Perhaps someone can comment on my review to clarify this point to a Wittgenstein newcomer. :) \\n The author presents the material very clearly and succinctly, but there were several times when I wasn\\'t sure if it was the author\\'s point of view that was being articulated or Wittgenstein\\'s. Quotations from Wittgenstein\\'s journals early on in the book gave me hope that the rest of the book would follow suit, using quotes extensively when articulating something specifically written or thought by Wittgenstein, but it did not do this regularly, and I think the book suffers slightly for it. \\n I still give the book 4/5 Stars, because it does such a great job at covering all the bases: biography, philosophy, history, influences, major works, etc. I repeat, though, the one thing this book really needs more of is quotes from the author, like in the \"How to Read...\" series, which I might read now that I have read this book. I have read both How to Read Heidegger and How to Read Derrida, both of which are great primers for the respective authors, so I expect nothing less from them at this point. Additionally, the connection between Wittgenstein and Derrida seems obvious to me, just from reading this small primer, so I might continue an investigation there too, something I wish the author had done, but in a book meant as a basic intro, I don\\'t hold it against them in any way. \\n In conclusion, I definitely recommend this book, though I might recommend the How to Read series more, once I\\'ve read that one as well.

That being said it does not take away at all my enjoyment of this book and one can easily read this novel without getting confused. \\n If you enjoyed the movie based on these characters I strongly suggest reading this book.

As far as I can tell, the story of the two mage-killers-for-hire is supposed to compliment the story of DAI; however, having played the game I can't say this comic really adds anything to the experience. While the art is well-done and vivid, the plot is all over the place and lacks any central theme or purpose.

       "  \"This first volume of Way's Wolverine is wildly uneven, and isn't entirely coherent because it covers several years of stories (and even one non-Wolverine story) but it generally shows off his strengths as a writer and makes me want to see more of the actual Origins series. \\n We start off at the end of Wolverine v2, where Way closed out to the volume with some short filler stories. It's great to see these finally reprinted. They're both very odd stories that pull Wolverine off into weird genres, but they're quite well written. \\n Down the Road (187). A Wolverine ghost story? A Wolverine urban legend? This issue, set on the road, rather delightfully unravels a story over the course of a car trip [7+/10]. \\n Good Cop / Bad Cop (188-189). Pretty much a dark police procedural where Wolverine largely plays a supporting role. It probably wouldn't be great as part of an ongoing run, but it's a very nice one-off to end Wolverine v2 [7/10]. \\n Three years on, during which time Wolverine was written by Greg Rucka (Wolverine, by Greg Rucka: Ultimate Collection) and Mark Miller (Wolverine: Enemy of the State). Now, Daniel Way is brought back and dumped straight into House of M. \\n House of M: Chasing Ghosts (33-35). This is just a flat-out fun story. I mean, it's got Mystique and Wolverine as Agents of SHIELD. But more than that, it's a story with an interesting narrative structure and a mystery that's explored over the course of the three issues. So, combine good storytelling with that good premise! [7/10]. \\n The Promise (My Mutant Heart). A one-trick super-short that's OK but has ugly art [5/10]. \\n And then we're on to the actual Origin stories that constitute most of Way's Wolverine work, for better or for worse. Sadly, this collection doesn't include the actual event in House of M where Wolverine recovers his memories, so we just have to figure that out on our own. \\n Origins & Endings (36-40). This book has a great premise: Wolverine has recovered his memories, and he's angry as heck. He wants some vengeance! Unfortunately, the actual implementation is horrible. It's literally incoherent. He fights Silver Samurai for some reason, then he messes around with SHIELD, then he attacks Bucky. It's never clear what's going on or what Logan's remembering or why he's doing what he's doing. The Winter Soldier issues at the end are the only ones that start to come clear, as we get a bit more of the backstory. Way would do a much better job on this plot thread in the Origins comic that followed, but here it's a mess [4/10]. \\n Born in Blood (Origins 1-5). Wolverine: Origins & Endings, the beginning of the Wolverine: Origins epic was pretty incoherent. Now, given the whole Wolverine: Origins series to spread out over, Way is able to tell a somewhat more cohesive story. Oh, it's still very muddy and still doesn't explain itself, but this time it feels more like Way knows what he's doing. \\n And, there's a lot to like here, including great use of Nuke, and the first hints that the Weapon X program and the super-soldier program have something in common. Finally, we get the first confirmation that Logan has a son. A lot of this is setup for what follows, but it's nice setup. \\n On the downside, Captain America feels pretty out of character, and Steve Dillon's art is as ugly as ever. [7/10] \\n Sabertooth (Sabertooth 1-4). Oh, hey, four issues reminding us that Sabertooth is a loonie-toon sociopath. There's just barely a story here. I don't know why they bothered with a whole mini-series, nor do I know why it's reprinted here. But it's kind of exciting and has some good characters, so its not entirely bad as brainless horror.

       "  'There have been years of bad Doom Patrol comics since Grant Morrison\\'s Doom Patrol v2. Some authors tried to ignore Morrison\\'s weirdness, or even ignobly reboot continuity, like John Byrne\\'s irrelevant Doom Patrol v4 or the nu52 Doom Patrol. Others tried to go with the weirdness but disprespected the characters, like John Arcudi\\'s Doom Patrol v3, or just didn\\'t know what they were doing, like Keith Giffen\\'s Doom Patrol v5. \\n Gerard Way is the first author to try and return to Grant Morrison\\'s strength and to do it right too. (Except maybe Rachel Pollack? I didn\\'t love her at the time, but since DC is finally collecting her work, it\\'ll be time to reassess her soon.) \\n This is a classic weird-zo Doom Patrol, in a story all about Danny the Street, focused on some bizarre bad guys too. There\\'s also weird drama about the Negative Being, which might be the coolest part of the book. And if it\\'s not obvious from that description, this Doom Patrol v6 also does a great job of incorporating its weird characters. And it\\'s a nice cast of not just Cliff and Jane and Larry, but also Flex and Danny and even a new character, \"Space Case\", who has a delightful origin. \\n This volume does still have some weaknesses. It\\'s a little too scattered with individual pages of foreshadowing constantly interrupting the narrative. And, I don\\'t feel like many of the characters (especially Flex and the Chief) get as much focus as they should. But I\\'m looking forward to where it goes and hope it can evolve into another great run.'),\n",

Previously \"Homecoming\" was the story of Aric thrown back through time to his original tribe. It was cool, but ultimately of limited importance. Here we instead get Aric landing on Earth with the Visigoth tribe that he liberated from the Vine and trying to create a new home for them. And, it\\'s glorious. This is the sort of thing that you don\\'t typically see in superhero comics: global events with global response. I was absolutely enthralled wondering what was going to happen next (and shaking my head as things spun out of control in different ways). This is an original story, well told [9/10]. \\n Unity & The King (19-22, Unity 1-4). This overall crossover is a nice continuation of the events of X-O Manowar: Homecoming that refuses to hit any reset buttons, but instead continues to relentlessly push forward the narrative. \\n Of the two crossing over comics, X-O Manowar is the stronger. Venditti continues to do a superb job not just of characterizing Aric, but also of growing the character. As ever, I\\'m eager to see where the story of him (and his people!) goes next. Unfortunately, I wasn\\'t thrilled by the artist on the X-O issues. He\\'s not bad, but he\\'s stylized enough that the art melds badly with Unity [8/10]. \\n The Unity issues don\\'t have the same emotional depth as the X-O issues, perhaps because we\\'re seeing a larger cast of characters and perhaps because they\\'re just coming together. However, I love the global scope of this comic, and I love how dynamic it is. If both of these elements continue, then it should become great as Kindt becomes more comfortable with the characters [7/10]. \\n Overall, this is another fine volume of X-O Manowar.'),\n",

       "  'Overall, this book is worth reading primarily for the Weapon X stories and the original two Wolverine mini-series. They\\'re all still great. From there, you move on to descending quality. The Wolverine regular series is the only other thing of real substance, and it never finds its footing, while the many crossovers are mainly of interest for completeness sake. It might actually be better just to buy nice hardcovers of the three best stories ... but if you want everything Wolverine, this is the way to get it. \\n ** Weapon X. BWS\\' Weapon X is, somewhat surprisingly, just as brilliant as it was 25 years ago. The artwork and the storytelling are top-rate, especially for how they work hand in hand. The actual writing technique is so tight into the story that you feel you\\'re right there, making it totally enthralling. Finally, we have a brutal and vivid origin for Logan that\\'s still in use so long afterward. [10/10] \\n Hulk (180-182). Sure, these are the stories that introduced Wolverine, but they\\'re stunningly bad. I mean, a few pages are dedicated to the Hulk fighting wolves. And the art isn\\'t that great either [3/10]. \\n Shorts. The shorts from MT and a Best of hardcover are OK, but not much beyond that [5/10]. \\n ** Wolverine. Claremont and Miller\\'s original Wolverine miniseries is still astoundingly good. The integration of Wolverine into Japan is perfect, especially with its combination of modern crime and ancient Samurai culture. The characterization of Wolverine himself is also very strong. Hand-in-hand, Miller really steps up with the artwork, especially in the final issue, which is sublime [9/10]. \\n The X-Men issues that follow are a very nice coda to the series. Though they\\'re not as strong, they show why Claremont\\'s X-Men writing was great at its height, because the two issues are equally pivotal for Wolverine, Rogue, and Storm. [7/10] \\n ** Kitty Pryde & Wolverine. Claremont weirdly seems to like transforming his western girls into Japanese ninjas. Nonetheless, this first take on the topic is a good one -- a great character study of both Kitty Pryde and Wolverine (though it\\'s more Kitty\\'s story than Logan\\'s). The Japanese color is also very nice, and I love how these old mini-series interweaved with the main series (X-Men), rather than Wolverine magically being everywhere at once. Bits of this are a bit wordy, and I think it runs an issue or so too long, but it\\'s still a strong read. [7/10] \\n Miscellanea. The Captain America story is a mediocre crossover that\\'s saved only by the clear differences in character between Rogers and Logan [5/10]. The Spider-Man story is superb. It\\'s actually more of a Spider-Man story than a Wolverine story, but there\\'s a beautiful contrast between the characters and a nice view of Wolverine\\'s pre X-Men life [9/10]. The Hulk (340) story nicely show how the characters have gornw, but isn\\'t important beyond that [6/10]. \\n Save the Tiger (MCP). This is a disappointing comic, given Claremont\\'s previous strength in his two earlier Wolverine series. Granted, this one had severe constraints in its 8 page story segments ... but the problem is it\\'s just not very interesting, even ignoring the introduction of characters like Razorfist (and Patch!) that seem like self-parody. Still, it creates an interesting new environ and some good characters for the first Wolverine continuing series [5/10]. \\n **The Wolverine Regular Series. \\n The Black Blade (1-3). Claremont makes better use of the Madripoor setting in this follow-up to its Marvel Comics Present\\'s premiere, probably in part because he\\'s no longer writing in 8-page segments. However, this story is also written slightly better and feels more connected to the previous Wolverine mini-series ... though Claremont continues to skirt the line of self-parody. Still, the supporting cast is nice and the plot line is a good one [6/10]. \\n Gang Wars (4-6). Claremont continues to nicely increase his supporting cast in this second story. Some of them are pretty silly, like Roughhouse and Bloodsport, but we also get the return of Karma and the general state of the gangs on the island. Though this story starts out a bit slow, the final issue is a nice bit of action [6/10]. \\n Joe Fixit (7-8). This is a direct continuation of the previous storyline, but it slowly transitions into a story about the modern Wolverine and the modern Hulk (Joe Fixit) and it turns out to be a somewhat delightful story, showing how much the two have changed as Wolverine joyfully plays tricks on the Hulk! [7/10] \\n Promises to Keep (9). Though Peter David\\'s filler story is mainly a long hunt, it shows some depth that hasn\\'t been present in Claremont\\'s stories in this new Wolverine series. It really goes to the heart of Logan\\'s character, both in the past and the present [7+/10]. \\n 24 Hours (10). Claremont\\'s last Wolverine story is his best, in part because it\\'s got more appropriate art than the clean superhero art that ran through issues #1-8, but in part because it\\'s a better story. By now Claremont has done a good job of creating the situation and characters in Mardipoor, so he can simply use them. This is also a wonderfully iconic story of Sabretooth [7+/10]. \\n Unfortunately I felt like Claremont\\'s creation of the Mardipoor environment for Wolverine was a waste. It was too artificial and too at-odds with the 4-color superheroes of the time period. As a result, it always struck a wrong note, particularly in these early tales. \\n **End the Wolverine Regular Series. \\n Punisher War Journal. A pretty \"meh\" end to the book. Wolverine is hunting poachers, Punisher is \"on vacation\" and hunting dinosaurs. They fight by mistake, then they do it again [3/10].'),\n",

Williams run) to form a team tasked to surmount this inevitable conflict. \\n I liked how Tynion made use of the DC characters in the Batman mythos who have been either scarce or totally absent during the New52 era. The author did not make me feel that the two Bats are recruiting them just for screen time. They felt as a start of something great, a team and a really good one. \\n So DetCom #934 is a recruitment issue. And we have seen this so many times in movies and comics. The fun here is the variety of personalities during the recruitment and Tynion nails it. Despite each team members\\' action scenes lasting for only a few panels, they are effective and entertaining to see. But who I think stole the show are the villains: Azrael and Clayface. \\n Jean-Paul Valley was a famous Batman character during the 90s, especially in the Knightfall era. He stole the show and embodied an \"aesthetic\" Batman that kinda reflects the comics of that decade. I got so excited seeing him again, updated in a \"Arkham Knight-esque\" costume. His spiritual personality is still intact, loyal to a fault to the Order. \\n Then there is Basil Karlo, a.k.a. Clayface. Now, what\\'s with DC making heroes out of villains? First Killer Croc in Suicide Squad (well, not really), then SuperLuthor then Clayface. Forever Evil proved to us that villains can become cool, effective heroes too. Haha, but Clayface ain\\'t effective and cool. He\\'s effective and cute! So Clayface being in the team is a good move! \\n Barrows\\' subdued contrasts is effective in a DetCom landscape, obviously since this is a Batman comic. The choice of characters turns out to be a good choice of colors as well. There\\'s Batman purple, Batwoman red among other colors. \\n Rebuilding the Batman family in the face of uncertainty is a way to go for Detective Comics. I think we are in for one great ride.'),\n",

       "  'see full review @ Katie\\'s Corner \\n Today I\\'m having yet another work by Mayu Shinjo. It\\'s a relatively small story compared to Sensual Phrase only 7 volumes long. However, I\\'ll be doing two reviews on it, so look forward to the next one somewhere next week! Why did I decide to make to reviews? Well, because the story has two events, therefore I want to cover each separately. Today\\'s review will cover Kirara as the idol. \\n So let me begin: meet Kirara Nakazono - an aspiring idol, who as she herself says has no talent but has the enthusiasm to become the first! \\n (That actually happens much, much later, but I just wanted to put it here) to gain popularity she takes part in various late night shows as well as some variety ones. However, everything changes when her manager - Hanamaki, throws he inside an apartment with words: \"get your body out there and get a job!\" \\n Yes, it does happen! It also doesn\\'t help the situation that Kirara is a virgin. But don\\'t forget this is a romance story; therefore a silver-haired prince (Wolf in disguise) appears to help Kirara! However, his motives are not all that pure and you\\'ll be laughing when you get to read them. Who is this silver-haired prince that stole Kirara\\'s heart in a flash? Meet our man lead - Ginzou Fujiwara or for short Gin - the most influential man in Japan (well, after his dad and grandpa). He takes a strange interest in Kirara and wants to make her his. Will he succeed? And by succeeding I mean to make both Kirara\\'s body and heart completely his. Start reading now and find out, how Fin will be trying to seduce Kirara! \\n Now, you can stop reading if you are afraid of spoilers, as I\\'ll be discussing some issues that are tightly related to spoilers. But if you are interested, please continue! This story as Sensual Phrase is set in the world of Showbiz. However, we get to see how the author actually makes fun of some things. Surely there are serious moments too, like when Kirara conforms Gin in the very beginning about her dream, but the way Gin changes everything on a whim if he doesn\\'t like something is just comical. The best issue is Kirara\\'s virginity and her accused lewdness. I just couldn\\'t stop laughing when Gin is accusing he of being a pervert because her room is small. Her phrase: \"Let me lick you\" just made me fall down from the chair even when I was reading for the third time. I knew that she would say it, but the impact was still too strong. There are numerous jokes about Gin and Kirara, but in the end he still makes her his, that is a problem arises. \\n Gin being Gin is a very selfish and jealous person. As soon as he falls hard for Kirara he becomes a hardcore possessive boyfriend. His stunts and idiotic behavior made me laugh before Kirara was a virgin \\n well actually even after that. But as soon as he gets her, his jealousy was overwhelming. He wanted Kirara only for himself and even told her to leave the entertainment world. Here comes the problem. Kirara wanted to achieve her dream, so they became enemies, and now without Gin how will Kirara manage to climb to the top again? She will and it will be a hard journey especially if Gin is trying to sabotage her. But if you thought that Kirara was a complete idiot in the beginning, you get to see her differently now. She is a strong willed person who wants to achieve her dream and return to the one she loves the most! \\n Are you ready to read Kirara and Gin\\'s story? It\\'s full of love, fantastic humor and lots of misunderstandings that make you laugh. You\\'ll also get to see one of your favourite characters from Sensual Phrase to appear! Don\\'t miss the 2nd review of this fabulous story, as now it\\'s Gin\\'s turn to climb to the top! Enjoy it to its fullest and don\\'t forget to share your thoughts below! Stay tuned for more reviews as well as promos. Don\\'t miss your next favourite book or manga! Happy reading! \\n XOXO \\n Katie'),\n",

       "  'Batman #21 is a delight to read in so many levels. I am absolutely entertained reading this issue, in fact the second best that I have read in DCs Rebirth era (next to Geoff Johns\\' DC Universe Rebirth). So before I go to my spoiler-filled review, let me just say again that this is a must-buy for everybody who loves comics. \\n To fully enjoy this issue and the whole DC Rebirth thing, it is imperative that you have already read Watchmen (and perhaps Before Watchmen\\'s Dr. Manhattan) and Flashpoint because there are many elements that give reference to those two materials. Tom King\\'s 9-panel layout is a nod to Alan Moore\\'s work, melding symmetry and parallelism in each beautifully drawn box. And DC gave the honor of drawing the pages of issue #21 to Jason Fabok, a dude who is so familiar with Batman (Batman Eternal, Detective Comics). \\n Batman issue 21 is the first of four parts. \\n Although not much has been revealed to the readers, the little things that have happened in this issue, which by the way happened mostly in the cramped space of the Batcave are nothing less than awesome. Perhaps the most significant thing that we have learned is (again spoiler alert) that the Button can act as a channel which can tap into the speed force and eventually see this \"god\" thing. Even Reverse Flash didn\\'t stand a chance against this god, or should I assume, Dr. Manhattan. So the Button\\'s a sort of portal and that I believe is a key element in this Rebirth-Watchmen story. \\n I also love the 24-esque style of narrative device to emphasize the concept of time for speedsters, where everything happens very fast. This and the overly amazing and bloody mano-a-mano fight between Reverse Flash and Batman is worth every cent you have paid for this issue. \\n Batman issue 21 is the first of four parts. I don\\'t complain if it scarcely revealed anything. If the DC Rebirth story is as good as this, then the writers and creative teams have all the time in the world.'),\n",

       "  \"This is such a fun graphic novel series! Rat Queens follows a band of all lady Dungeons and Dragons-type adventurers who fight monsters, make trouble, and frequent the pub. This is going to be a great series for fans of RPGs, as there are so many references to video game and D&D mechanics. It's as if the series is winking and nodding to RPG fans. Even if you aren't an RPG player, this series has so much for everyone. The Rat Queens are a varied band, with women of all sizes, races, and sexualities. They are all quick witted, funny, and unique. I was so excited to learn more of their backstories and see what else this series has to offer. \\n Unfortunately, I will not be continuing this series after Volume 3 due to choices made by the creative team to welcome back the co-creator (who was arrested for domestic violence), after they had told the female artist that he would not be coming back and that she would be the artist moving forward. It was a shitty mess. If you want to know more about this in detail, this article goes into all of it. Now, as of late 2016, the series is going on a print hiatus and will only be a webcomic for a while. I'm wondering if the backlash caused this series to flounder. Which is such a shame, as it had so much promise and I would have gladly continued if the co-creator did not return. \\n So while I adore this series, and plan to read those first few volumes, I ultimately know I will not be continuing and can't really recommend it to others based on that.

As he grows into his role as team captain, he must balance his desire to win with fairness and allowing others to participate, even if their skills are not as strong as he would like. Squish learns so many valuable lessons over the soccer season: \\n - Discover the strengths of your team members and utilize them to best advantage. \\n - Giving a teammate a chance to succeed is also giving a teammate a chance to fail. And vice versa. \\n - Winning feels good, but having fun is just as important. \\n Another graphic novel series by the Holm siblings, aimed at chapter book readers, but the Squish series doesn't have the magic of the Babymouse books. All the characters in this series are microorganisms. The color scheme is black, white, and green, since this series targets boys. Squish, an amoeba, loves comic books, especially his favorite superhero, Super Amoeba. It's a strength of this series, and a tribute to the power of literature in children's lives (yes, comic books are children's literature, too), that the issue of Super Amoeba that Squish is reading parallels whatever is going on in Squish's own life.

       "  \"So the core Convergence book was quite possibly the worst volume that DC released in 2015. Can the connected mini-series be in better? Yeah, but that's honestly not a very high bar. \\n The biggest problem is that the conceit for these comics is so constrained that no one can tell good stories. We pretty much get an issue of characterization followed by a call to action and then an issue of fight. Again and again. It was wonderful to see these old, lost characters again, but DC pretty much ruined their return by only allowing mediocre stories through. \\n Superboy & The Legion of Super-Heroes. A nice take on the Legion, primarily for its focus on Clark and Ayla. The fight with the Atomic Knights is the sort of dull thing that I'm expect we're going to see a lot of in these Convergence books. And, there's some really horrible art in the first issue that makes every ugly, angry, and wan. (It's much better in the second issue, due to some changes in the art team.) If I'd bought this book instead of just borrowing it from the library, it would have been for this story; I'm glad I didn't [4/10]. \\n The Green Lantern Corps. I wonder if this is going to be a trend for these stories: the first issue has great character, then the second issue lets that down. Crisis Guy Gardner is really terrific, playing up the travails of the character, but not his later inanity. The second issue, though, gives us more of a '90s Guy Gardner character, cycling through silly alter egos. It manages to avoid pointless battles with heroes from other cities, but it still offers weak interactions (with Hercules!) and weak fights (with some thing!) [5+/10] \\n Batman and the Outsiders. This is a long-lost team that it's really delightful to see again, and Andreyko does a good job of characterizing them. Then, he even gives the foes some depth in the inevitable rightful second issue. Things are still pretty skippable when we get to the big fight, but this was an enjoyable read [5+/10]. \\n Adventures of Superman. Wolfman improves on what most of his fellows are doing by actually giving his heroes some agency. Kal and Kara aren't moping around about being stuck Under the Dome (tm), they're journeying off to the Phantom Zone and having adventures that have nothing to do with this contrived crossover. Then, when we have the inevitable invasion, it's a multisided affair with Kamandi against the apes. And of course there's some strong characterization (which is all most of these stories seem to be built on), focused on Kara and what she learns of the future. The shape of this crossover continues to make it shallow, but this is nonetheless one of the better attempts [6/10]. \\n Hawkman. More of the same. Shayera has some nice characterization that doesn't matter because this is a one off and there's a great ending. But otherwise, it's forgettable as all the rest [5+/10]. \\n Even loving many of these old characters, I'm not sure I'm going to waste my time reading the rest of these.\"),\n",

Ah well. 10 and 12 focus on the Resurrection Crusade and Nergal and are nice issues. There's a bit too much philosophical wankery in issue #10, of the sort that sometimes spoils Delano's writing. However in the end it offers some nice closure, and #12 does so even moreso. They're good plot-heavy issues [7/10]. On the other hand Newcastle is superb, not just for its revelation of Constantine's past, but also for the way that it shows the past of Constantine's crew, carefully lifted from both Swamp Thing and Delano's own initial issues. The story has a great kick to it and remains one of the landmark Constantine tales.

No wonder the lines above on how he hates the world around him perfectly bespeak his internal thinking. Therefore, he becomes a sociopath. \\n In other perspective, I therefore believe that Eric is an epitome of an idealistic and \"Emo\" person. A person is said to be idealistic when he or she wants to live according to his/ her own standard far from the realistic universe. Actually, the idea is associated with utopian feelings. \\n Emo , on the other hand, is a slang for being extremely emotional referring to people who are usually said to be unable to deal with realistic situations befall them. Usually, most of \"Emos\" are said to be broken-hearted. As a matter of fact, the word Emo is a style of rock music characterized by expressive, often confessional, lyrics. It originated in the mid-1980s hardcore punk movement of Washington, D.C., where it was known as \"emotional hardcore\" or \"emocore\" and pioneered by bands such as Rites of Spring and Embrace. * In this generation, it is now the stereotype that when someone has this rock-style outfit , he/ she may be an Emo.( I don\\'t think so.) \\n Upon reading this, I could SUBJECTIVELY conclude that an Emo or an idealistic person could/ may be \\n *prone to depression \\n *a misanthropist \\n *a misogynist \\n *suicidal \\n *psychopathic \\n *a major offender. \\n *a man with higher degree of paranoia and hallucination. \\n I have watched dramas and movies with such common theme on the idealistic revenge of a man dumped by his girlfriend. However, I believe that Gerry\\'s story is original. In fact, Gerry wrote it in the 1990\\'s. Or Gerry may have drawn the impression from the other books written in the 1980\\'s. Who knows? But I surmise that the story could reflect in his personality. ( Who am I to judge him? ) \\n Another good thing about the comic book is that it deals not just with the love story of a psychopath but also with the socio-political aspects. Obviously, there are some parts Eric projects his grievances to the government and society. Therefore, you may conclude that what centers around the story is the pursuit of JUSTICE. \\n I usually enjoy reading animation comics just the like of Doraemon written and illustrated by the manga writing team Fujiko Fujio, but when I joined The Graphic Novel Club on Goodreads, I came to the realization that comics are not different from other books. They could have sense-All books have sense! The best examples are Gerry Alanguilan\\'s. \\n Dear me, forgive my ignorance.Little did I know that there is such a world-class comics writer and illustrator just the like of Gerry Alanguilan. Hmmm... Hooray! I am gonna hunt his Elmer, Rodski Patotski: ang Dalagang Baby, and Underpass: A Summit Media Graphic Anthology. \\n *https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emo'),\n",

It's obvious by the fact that Kot spends two full issues just getting to know his cast (while simultaneously throwing out the throwaway villains from the initial run and introducing Cheetah and a certain new analyst). And, it's a wonderful get-to-know that really goes to who these people are and who Waller is. \\n Interspersed with that is a look at a future action in Vegas, and that just gives the story more weight when we alight there in issue #22. And, these action sequences are better than what we got in the first 19 issues too. They have a fun caper-ish feel to them, and our characters continue to be characters, not mindless fighting automatons. That continues on with #23. Do we finally finish off Regulus (again) here? Yay, the Suicide Squad is back. \\n Oh, and Kot starts to walk back the horrible, horrible idea that the Suicide Squad can just resurrect its fallen soldiers, turning it into a real plot point. Amidst the bad writing of the first three volumes, that was the worst plot idea, so it's good to see that Kot set out immediately to correct it. \\n Except, four issues is all we got of Kot. Sad.

       "  'If you are a Brian Vaughan fan, you already know his extraordinary talents, his gifts for crafting complex, engaging characters and his pitch perfect dialogue. Yet if you believe you\\'ve already experienced the full extent of his ability, then you\\'ll be delightfully surprised by \"Saga.\" At times in Volume 1, \"Saga\" made one suspect that this was Vaughan dipped in acid (and I mean this in a good way) - both in terms of the sharpness of the commentary and the at times psychedelic array of characters. Volume 2 pushes still further. Having constructed a setting that is part Larry Niven, part Wagner, with a generous splash of Kurt Vonnegut and just a dash of Heavy Metal, Vaughan can know focus more on developing his characters\\' complex relationships. \\n To summarize - and no summary could ever do justice to Saga - the story is a space opera. Two peoples, one based on magic and one on science, are locked in a long running, seemingly endless (and perhaps pointless) bloody conflict. When two soldiers, one from each side, fall in love, desert, and have a baby named Hazel (in that order), they attract the ire of both cultures. Seems simple, right? \\n Part of Vaughan\\'s genius is that it is anything but simple. His characters are so complex, his story so rich, that one can easily imagine folks at Hollywood studios reading this extraordinary book and deciding that it is time to just accept that most of what they produce will never measure up. This begins with our loving couple, neither of whom could be described as a paragon of virtue. Marko, the husband from the magical world (with the horns), is a dreamer and a conscientious objector who believes that their love can serve as a symbol to end the conflict. Alana, from tech based Landfall (with the wings), is a foul-mouthed romantic who fell in love with Marko while guarding him at a POW camp when they struck up a conversation about the romantic novel, \"A Nighttime Smoke.\" \\n The secondary characters are a rich cavalcade of intricate neurosis, conflicting relationships, and deadly motivations. All of which moves the story forward at a very brisk pace indeed. \\n Note please that this is Volume 2. While you might be able to pick up here, you\\'ll surely loose much of the magic. Read Volume 1 first and I\\'d lay good odds you\\'ll be running out to buy 2 as soon as you turn the last page if not before. \\n More than a word should also be said about Fiona Staples much admired art and how much it contributes to this story. Her style, at once whimsical and yet painfully real, so perfect suits this story that I feel bad so praising Vaughan, when her work contributes so much to the story. Indeed, I cannot imagine any other artist doing the story. \\n As you can tell, I\\'ve given only crumbs about the actual plot as it goes on here. I don\\'t want to spoil the pleasure of the read, even for those who have not yet picked up volume 1. \\n Oh, and did I mention that the whole story is narrated by Baby Hazel? Yeah, like I said, the whole thing is pure genius and a pure delight.'),\n",

This murder is perpetrated by Sam Lesser, a troubled young man treated by Mr. Locke. After this event, the three kids, along with their mother, who survived the attack, relocate from San Francisco to Lovecrat, Massachussetts. Until then, the story is full of tension and blood and violence, but fully grounded on reality. \\n This changes when they move into Keyhouse with their uncle Duncan Locke. The youngest of the three Locke kids, Bode, sets to explore the manor on his own. The distinction between reality and fantasy starts to blur when Bode discovers the Ghost Key, that allows the user to transform into a ghost when they cross the door it opens. As it happens, the house is more than just a house, and there seems to be a special connection with the Locke family. Bode also discovers the Lady in the Well, an evil being who claims to be no more than his echo. As the story furthers, we learn that this being is behind the murder of Rendell Locke and is helping Sam escape from the correctional facility where he had been locked after the murder. We know the Lady in the Well, or Dodge, is after something the Lockes have. But what exactly or why is it that he wants? \\n During the whole book, Joe Hill builds up tension and terror. I wanted to know more and I also wanted to stop reading. The plot is enough to make you scared and curious. It's really addictive. Nevertheless, I like that this graphic novel goes deeper than the supernatural element and the gore. The murder allows Joe Hill to explore how the survivors cope with guilt and the horrible memories of the event. Kinsey wants to disappear, to go unnoticed, which is reflected on her complete make-over. Their mother, Nina, has started drinking. Tyler is guilt-ridden, to the point of feeling directly responsible of the murder. It shows how skilled Hill is when it comes to character development, and these relatable quiet moments are what make Welcome to Lovecraft a masterpiece, since they balance the violence and terror so well. \\n The artwork, by Gabriel Rodriguez, is equally stunning. It has a cinematic feeling, with planes of great scope that then zoom in to a focal point, or a superposition of a certain character in different scenarios to show different layers of meaning for the same line of text. The characters are drawn in a deceptively simple style that allows for great complexity and detail. The drawings have as much personality as the characters themselves. He also makes a great use of perspective, far greater than I've ever seen in a graphic novel - it really enhances the different plot points. Joe Hill and Gabriel Rodriguez are definitely a match made in heaven.\"),\n",

       "  \"This is a superb history of the British popular comic from Ally Sloper in the 1880s through to Judge Dredd and beyond. \\n There is a coherent history to British popular culture with patterns repeating themselves in other genres than comics - see our review of McKay's history of Hammer Horror at http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/... \\n An individual British style and creativity certainly exists but economic conditions - depression, war, imperial drawdown, the recession of the 1970s and American competition - make the story a sad one. \\n Time and time again, success is short term and troubled. It is no surprise to find great creative talent nurtured by what was once a superb educational system fuelling the American industrial machine. \\n The wise know that one of the triumphs of 'old' Labour was an educational system that put creative opportunities in the way of the English working and lower middle classes - the creative explosion in music, design, film and graphics arose out of that policy. \\n Sadly, much of this looks like being thrown away by Daily Mail stupidity about 'standards' and current and recent education ministries of startling authoritarian ineptitude. The results will be seen in due course. \\n As for comics, the arrival of Dan Dare in the 1950s and the profusion of great children's comics in that decade and in the 1960s were a high point, even if they have skewed the world view of anyone over 50. \\n This was an era when it appeared culturally credible that the British were still a heroic people with an independent role in the world - we flew to Venus, saved the world and beat the Nazis and the 'Nips'. \\n Sometimes, I muse without evidence that some of our more ridiculous adventures in foreign parts owe more to Commando, Valiant and the movie version of 'Zulu' than the baby boomer liberals would like to admit. \\n Plucky military Brits or space cadets defeat Rommel and the Mekon much as their successors send younger men to die against the Taliban and 'Saddam'. Warren Ellis' 'Ministry of Space' is a nice, almost elegiac, corrective. \\n 2000AD was a second high point but one restricted somewhat to one stable with no renaissance across the sector. Classically English dystopianism was soon exportable and modified for an America less at ease with itself. \\n Today, an authentic genius like Alan Moore and great contributors like Neil Gaiman and Warren Ellis largely work in an American cultural context although all have created works that exhibit a strong British sensibility. \\n We have seen a similar British input into Hollywood from Directors who cut their teeth on the highly creative world of British advertising so that the British creatively do 'punch above their weight' globally while still not reaping the full economic benefits. \\n British actors have also been central to most of the great Hollywood mythos - originally as villains (that accent!) but latterly as wise ancient ones (that accent!). Naturally , we are neither. \\n Although there is very fine work here and British creativity has helped the US industry immeasurably, one gets the sense of lurches, starts and leaps, and desperation, reflecting a wider socio-economic culture, a nation on the 'down', rather than continuous development. \\n It is certainly arguable that the Japanese manga and French (even Italian fumetti possibly) traditions, insulated from American capital by language and custom, are superior in achievement in terms of being a coherent cultural expression. \\n At some point, having been interrupted by total war, the British became wholly dependent on being the antechamber to America, almost certainly with the economic crises of the 1970s which also effectively destroyed Hammer. \\n There is an instructive and ambiguous little tale in the book that should be read by every national politician. A last gasp 'moral panic' caused the banning of 'violent' American comic books in the 1950s but this was not as straightforward as it might have seemed. \\n British distributors were making money out of these comics and they might have accumulated the capital to create new and exciting indigenous material if a Government had not been pressured by campaigners who undercut this market overnight. \\n 'Dan Dare' filled the gap as did the British war comic but these all looked backwards to imperial and wartime conditions. Modernity was delayed until the counter culture triggered new ideas but these ideas were not commercial and creative business was what the country needed. \\n That banning was fascinating because it can be compared with the struggles for sexual freedom that were then being won in the US and which have been described in our review of the biography of Russ Meyer - http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/... \\n The sexual revolution was also taking place in the UK as evidenced in Paul Willetts' life of Paul Raymond - http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/... - but any ability to build an adult-minded comic book sector was crushed by government. \\n But the government was not the villain. The original 'moral panic' had been engineered by a malign Communist Party which then managed to roll in the usual suspects - authoritarian school teachers, trades unions and social workers as well as the faith-based community. \\n Civil servants and politicians knew the claims were unevidenced nonsense but the pressure grew and the Conservative Government caved in for electoral reasons, just to shut up the backbenchers and media. \\n The case study is interesting because little has changed. The Communist Party is dead but their place has been taken by a similar malign alliance of 'Guardian' feministas and faith-based foundations and charities. \\n Today, the issue may be the war on sex workers amidst highly spurious and hysterical claims about sex trafficking and the game may be played by big Evangelical Foundations instead of the Third International but the unevidenced authoritarian manipulation is the same. \\n Alhough Government remains solid on evidence and common sense up to a point, this coalition's mobilisation of pig ignorant cynics in the tabloids could result in malign and cruel laws that do serious harm. \\n But back to the book. It is highly recommended and academically sound, with copious useful notes for further study and very fair assessments with little sign of national bias or 'ideology'. \\n The author recognises his work is not the last word on the matter but the serious student of British culture could do a lot worse than start here. \\n Americans in particular might be interested in the cultural background of comic writers of the importance of Moore, Gaiman and Ellis. A culture that gave us 'V for Vendetta' is not a negligible one.\"),\n",

One could argue that the story with Krona isn't the main story anyways as the main story is the interaction between DC and Marvel. And that aspect was terrific.

First is that it is written and illustrated by Aaron Felizmenio, whose artistic style in Minkowski Space Opera truly awed me. The second reason is this particular edition's cover, though not the one displayed here in Goodreads looks badass! It is reminiscent of another badass illustrator, Ashley Wood, the one who is responsible for the dark art of Metal Gear Solid. \\n Those are the only things good about Gwapoman 2000 because the content doesn't have anything good to offer. Felizmenio's artistic craft is promising but inconsistent that it truly affects the reader's appreciation towards the material. Although that is fairly understandable since this is a collected edition where the author have written the chapters at different times. \\n What is worse is that Ang Huling Baraha has a very incoherent plot that I kept on extrapolating what is really happening in the panels. From what I have read, this kid Alas frees a veteran vigilante-ish Gwapoman and later teams up with him to do a particular mission, only to find someone else - Margaux. I may be totally wrong here mind you! The abuse of flashbacks makes the story too convoluted to follow. The chapters are too disjointed you might think that Felizmenio only wrote what random adventure he has in mind. \\n The writing is as bad as how the story is told. The dialogues are uninspired and rife with loopholes, contributing to the lack of cohesiveness in the story. There are times that the script is too random that I didn't bother understanding it. You feel that Felizmenio tries to give unique voices to each character but he fails to do so unfortunatey. The narrative boxes reflect his shot at doing prose but they are shallow and empty. For someone who has much potential as Aaron Felizmenio, he really needs a writer partner. \\n And I have not said the worst thing in Gwapoman 2000: it is lack of editing. I just wonder HOW the material got published with all the misspelled words, grammatical errors and overlooked typos. Lame and shameful. \\n I still earnestly urge you to buy this book though because personally, I never abandoned my trust with the local indie komiks industry.

I didn't like Zdarsky's Sex Criminals either, though that one was at least better than this one. \\n 2 stars because there were occasional decent bits, but overall I regret reading it. It's really bordering on that 1 star. There were quite a few times I thought about DNF, but I kept going because it's so short. \\n The writing was just slipshod. The world building was haphazard. It seemed like it tried to be Saga but had no base to make it feel real. Saga feels like a real universe, this just felt like garbage thrown together to feel kooky. There was a lot of weird stuff everywhere, but for weirdness sake. \\n The characters were a mix of things. The main guy, a gay biological scientist that is used to being bullied ends up on this weirdo planet and is totally fine with not going back to earth because everyone there sucks. Being gay only kind of has a purpose to his character. Like much of the rest of the book, it seems tacked on just so the main character is gay. A lot of the other characters seem to be kind of stereotypes. The physics scientist is a military brodude that bullies the weak gay bio guy. (He's also the first to die inexplicably) The pilot is gung ho Mr. Handsome, no challenge too small (second to die). On the alien planet there are humans (more or less) with a prince that is full of himself but is actually a bumbling fool. A guard that is totally into his job and has a HISTORY (not revealed). A cat thing hunter lady. A motivational orb (floating orb with cheezy situational one liners). And a mix of other stuff. \\n The artwork wasn't horrible, but I didn't really care for that either. It had really awkward posing. Overly vibrant colors on just about everything (too much). Sloppy line work. Everything was ...bubbly, for lack of a better word. I don't know if there were hardly any straight lines in the entire book. Just not for me overall.\"),\n",

This is the first arc that actually feels like it goes to the heart of the issue: Cornell does a good job of both having Wolverine confront death and continuing the Sabertooth story while he does [7+/10]. \\n The Last Wolverine Story (10-12). Cornell finally closes off his Sabertooth story, but it's a little disappointing. Sure, Wolverine has some nice character moments as he comes to terms with being vulnerable ... but it feels like a big waste since we all know this is just treading water. Then the rest of the story is a big long fight with some fighting on the side [5/10]. \\n The Shorts that end #12 are actually quite good, reminding us that Cornell is a great author when given his opportunity to shine. I particularly liked his story about the bar, Guernicus. Sadly, like so much in this run, it feels like something neat that we're never going to see again. [8/10] \\n Overall, I'm not sure what went wrong with Cornell's run, but it wasn't Wolverine's finest hour. He certainly didn't get a chance to build good continuity, having his run split down the middle between two volumes. He also didn't get to tell the end-point of his story, thanks to some weird politics at Marvel. However, I also think he was telling stories that didn't go to Wolverine's strengths, between the weird-science of the nanovirus of V1 and Wolverine's mopiness and out of characterness here. Still, this volume was stronger than the one that came before it, and it was good to see things brought to an end for the run. \\n Wolf & Cub (Annual). I wasn't thrilled to find that the annual that finished things off was by another author, but it turned out to be good -- a nice coda for Logan and Jubilee before the end, though I'm not entirely certain of what I think about the moral message in the final pages, which tries to turn sexism on its head, but results in a borderline sexist message.

I suspect that\\'s only half the story, as it was obvious that DC was also uncomfortable with the Five-Years-Later Adult Legion that ended the original Legion era. Late in that run they tried to bring back the youth of the Legion with a badly conceived group of clones, but it just made things even messier. So, in that regard, the original Legion was certainly a mess by its final date. \\n Enter Zero Hour and with it the Reboot (Two-Boot) Legion. \\n Waid, McCraw, and Peyer do a good job of returning the Legion to its core. We get young, optimistic heroes living in an optimistic future. Things start off with the traditional origin story, but the authors don\\'t let things remain there for long. Within a few months we have a fairly large cast, and by the end of the volume we have a total of 13 Legionnaires. \\n Meanwhile, the authors mix classic villains like Mano with new ones. The white-triangle racists are a scary group, while Tangleweb is just a bit too silly. Still, overall the adversaries are good. And the plots are even better: the authors don\\'t let their optimistic future stop them from telling serious stories. \\n They also do a great job with the characters. Quite a number of them, including Garth, Violet, Triad, and Andromeda all have interesting character arcs, and that\\'s to say nothing of totally new characters like Gates, XS, and Kinetix, who are all totally worthy additions to the Legion. \\n The choice to constrain most of the stories to just two issues really pays out, and the only story that drags, on the Planet Hell prison, just happens to be the one that goes a little longer. However, I\\'m even more intrigued with the interweaving storylines that start up in the last few issues, because that\\'s the type of more complex storytelling that the Legion was known for when it was at its best. \\n I was never happy with the constant reboots of the Legion that began in the \\'90s, but nonetheless the Two-Boot Legion was a worthwhile run that early on had a light spirit (despite some serious plots) that really distinguished them. Hopefully DC will actually follow through this time and keep publishing these volumes (as well as \"The Legion\" volumes that represent the latter half of the run, when it got more serious).'),\n",

It isn\\'t at all. \\n The Adventures of the Princess and Mr. Whiffle tell a tale of a little princess who lives alone in a castle made of marzipan. Her best friend is her stuffed teddy bear, Mr. Whiffle. These two do everything together and readers get a glimpse of that within the first part of the story. \\n The unique aspect of this book is that it \"ends\" three different times. The first section of the book will leave readers with a sugary sweet ending, the middle one is a little sad and the last ending is the one that makes it clear that this book was NOT a children\\'s book. Where you leave the story off is up to you. Readers can read one, read two or all three and get a complete story each time that they read the story. \\n As an avid fan of teddy bears, children\\'s stories and anything out of the ordinary. After I had been shown the preview pictures that were released last year I felt this book could have been written for myself. I was eager to see what The Adventures of the Princess and Mr. Whiffle held. \\n The book is a very quick read with only a dozen or so words per page at the most. It stands at 72 pages and most are full page pictures that spread over a single page or both pages. \\n While this story is definitely not one I\\'d read to the normal picture book audience, I believe that it would be fine for an \"older\" child who is okay with a bit of a sinister dark side to stories. For the adults, this book takes us back to our childhood a little but this time it shows a sinister side that picture books didn\\'t have. There are essentially two readers that will enjoy this book. Adults and older children. I think some teens might not understand the big deal behind the book and younger children will be a bit scared, too little to understand it. \\n Personally I enjoyed the story. As stated it holds all the elements that I hold near and dear to my heart. With that aside, I think a lot of readers might be very very disappointed in the book. Why? There was so much hype to this book and I just don\\'t believe that it really lives up to that hype. There are very very few words to the book, the story is over before it began. Those that have children might enjoy reading this out loud and seeing their expression as you read the book outloud but for some adults it might be a bit disappointing. \\n While the story is quick and a bit short the real gem within this book are the pictures by Nate Taylor. I\\'ve read this book a half dozen times and each time I find myself looking over the pictures and just loving them. There are tiny little details that I didn\\'t see the first or second time I read it. These pictures are what saves this book. \\n Overall, this picture book for adults/older readers will be a hit or miss book. It\\'ll depend on what your expectations are going into the book. If you\\'re looking for an adult story with pictures and details, you won\\'t find it here. If you\\'re looking for a quick fun read that you can occasionally pull out on rainy days, then you\\'ll enjoy this book.'),\n",

Some other dimension technology baddie is holding an inquisition to destroy all magic from all dimensions.

Dr. Strange deals with the increasing levels of minor weirdness that doesn't usually come to this realm including mind maggots and magic eating slugs, and travels around across a few dimensions trying to figure out what's going on. He realizes magic is dying somehow, but not sure why. \\n Some of the weird stuff was pretty neat, but some of it just seemed weird for weirdness sake. The art did a nice job of separating the weird from the normal and took a lot of cues from things like Wonderland and LSD inspired imagery mixed with not-quite-Lovecraftian horror. Colors were great, a lot of the illustration was great. Dr. Strange though I didn't quite care for. My biggest complaint was that he looked as if he never had any expression. You never (except on rare occasion) see his eyes or mouth at all. His head is almost always turned down and angled, so his eyes are shadowed and all you see is a moustache.

These problems don't go together well, because they result in an overall story where pretty much nothing is happening because each fragment of the story only gets a tiny bit of movement. That's sort of still going on here, in a Hawkgirl story that doesn't go anywhere, but fortunately the rest of the comic has reached a big climax which helps it to recover some of its momentum. \\n With that said, I was somewhat surprised by this comic's sharp right-hand turn. In the first two volumes, it had very much been Ultimate JSA, but here it seems to moving more toward a sort of post-apocalyptic super worldview of the type seen in comics like Injustice: Gods Among Us and Kingdom Come. It's not a bad direction, but it's a surprise, with the result that this comic is less and less about the JSA and more and more about ... apocalyptic showdowns. \\n Sadly, this book doesn't have an ending, as is too often the case in Nu52 volumes. However, it was quite an enjoyable read getting there. \\n I was pretty unhappy to hear that Robinson was forced off the title after this issue; it's, in fact, what made me decide to read it from the library instead of buying it myself.

I particularly love the intricate history detailed in the issue of Secret Origins, which shows how carefully the DC editors polished the backstory of the post-Crisis universe before releasing it to the public -- something that modern DC could have learned from, as their nu52 history was changing on a weekly basis post-reboot. But, beyond that, you have bright colorful artwork, laughable rogues, occasional footnotes, and a grimdark that is so far from the modern idea of grimdark that it's almost unrecognizable (and a lot more fun!). \\n There are also some great stories here, all tightly compressed, unlike the meandering stories of the modern-day. The Jihad story (1-2) immediately sets out to characterize long-time characters like Boomer and Deadshot, while also offering a tense story. The Darkseid story (3) offers great connections to Legends, and thus the early post-Crisis universe. The Heller story (4) shows off the social conscience of these early stories. The Russian arc (5-7) offers a great look at the Cold War, but also at the Pyrrhic victories that were so common for the Squad, and which made for such great stories. Finally, the final story (8) is just character. Wow! \\n And the real heart of all the Suicide Squad stories is that character. Years before the Secret Six or Superior Foes, Ostrander does a great job of turning these villains into characters that you love ... no matter how much you despise them. \\n As a whole, Suicide Squad rocked because it was so unlike anything else in comics at the time. Even today, it's deeply characterized and surprising for the medium. This first volume is definite 5-star material, because it hit the ground running. \\n Now if DC will just stick with these reprints THIS time.

Tying this character in to Vic\\'s own backstory is another example of how Wolfman was so effective at making these stories personal. \\n However, it\\'s the Blackfire (23-25+Annual) arc that really shines.

The story starts with Arrival-ish (Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner) feels, with a crack team on a quest to solve a puzzle, then things turned out drastically different at the end. \\n What I liked the least about The Wake is Snyder's tendency to over-lecture his readers about history and folklore. Although long-time readers of Snyder will definitely know that it is bound to happen somewhere in the story, The Wake is filled with exposition that there are times it felt really awkward for a certain character to be delivering a lesson given the circumstance they are in, you just don't give a fine lecture about myths and folklore when your life is on the line . \\n The Wake part one feels so underwater that Aquaman could have popped-up outta nowhere and participated in whatever is happening in the story.

       "  'Categories/Genres for this class fulfilled by this book: Graphic Novel \\n Estimate of age level of interest: Grades 9-12 \\n Estimate of reading level: Grade 5 \\n Brief description: \\n This graphic novel weaves three stories together. The first is the story traditional Chinese tale of the Monkey king. Next, is the story of a young Chinese boy, Jin, whose parents immigrated to the United States. Jin must deal with racism and being a middle school boy at the same time. Whew! The last story is the story of Danny whose Chinese cousin, Chin-Kee comes to visit him every year, forcing him to move to a different school each time. The three stories are kept separate, until the last chapter when the reader finds out how they actually all fit together. \\n Identify at least 2 characteristics of this genre and subgenre and discuss how they appear in your book: \\n Graphic novels are a series of panel illustrations that advance the narrative line (Chance 27). In American Born Chinese, the reader sees how things move and interact. For example, while the illustrations are usually within a black box, at times there is no box, showing the freedom of characters to move, and in one case, a character literally breaks out of the box in an attempt to exert power. \\n Graphic novels give \"a valuable glimpse into another culture and time period\" (Kiefer, 80). This novel shows the reader what it feels like to be Chinese. Some characters are given very stereotypical Asian features (Chin-Kee is a perfect example of this) and other try to deny their heritage through their appearance (Jin\\'s perm). The author could have used just words, but to see the physical transformation of characters is powerful. Readers can see how stereotypes literally affect the way someone is perceived by the world around them. \\n In what ways and how well does the book as a whole serve its intended audience?: \\n I think that this graphic novel will be a tough one for most middle school students. First, it has a picture of a young boy with a toy on its bright yellow cover. This will make most students feel like it is a book for a much younger audience.

This volume starts off with a previously uncollected Bendis Avengers story! Granted, there\\'s almost nothing to it, but it\\'s still thrilling to have this as a nice bonus [5/10]. \\n Silver Samurai (11-13). A nice follow-up to the initial arc\\'s prison escape, a nice continuation of the SHIELD conspiracy arc, and best of all an interesting introduction to a conflicted Jessica Drew ... but the fight against the Hand is very dull [5+/10]. \\n Spider-Woman & The Unveiling (G-S SW, 14-15). Fortunately, the next arc\\'s much stronger. The story of Spider-Woman\\'s return is great because it\\'s both a personal character story, and the sort of spy story that she does great in. Meanwhile, the unveiling of the New Avengers is touching, particularly for how it impacts Peter. Though I find it notable that it took 15 issues to get here, really demonstrating how decompressed the New Avengers is [7+/10]. \\n The Collective (16-20). This has always been my least favorite story in the original New Avengers run. I mean the idea of having a followup to House of M is good, and the idea of all the energy fields going somewhere, I guess that\\'s interesting, if pseudo-sciency. But it\\'s a painfully long five-issue fight; it\\'s totally disrespectful to Alpha Flight, who are \"killed off\" in a few panels to show how tough the mutant powers are; and it has no repercussions and was never again of relevance to the Decimation, as far as I know. [5/10] \\n New Avengers Annual #1. It\\'s about time this story made it into the New Avengers collections. It has crucial ties to the initial story arc, nicely advancing and reframing them, and for some reason it was only ever collected in The Pulse. Anywho, the main story is a punch\\'em up, but it\\'s actually interesting because of the teamwork and character dynamics. Meanwhile, we get a nice coda to Jessica\\'s story in Alias and The Pulse [7/10]. \\n Illuminati. Nice to have this story in its proper place too. This is a very slow, talky story, mainly intended as a setup for Civil War, but it creates a very intriguing group, and of course much more would be made of them. So, kudos for the imagination [7/10]. \\n Civil War (21-25). When I first read this in 2009 I found it phenomenal. An event crossover that focused on the characters was absolutely unheard of. In 2017 it became standard-operating practice for Marvel crossovers, and so this looks less amazing. They\\'re still nice character studies of the type you don\\'t usually see in group books, and they\\'re well written, but it\\'s more obvious now that they\\'re interruption of the bad-Shield-and-Hydra narrative that Bendis had going on [7/10]. \\n Civil War: The Confession. This dull book, that\\'s talky even for Bendis, only serves to justify the character assassination of Iron Man, who became Iron Fascist during the Civil War. It\\'s a boring read whose only saving grace is that it nicely bookends the Illuminati book at the start of the Civil War.'),\n",

(not exactly an origin, just a snippet from their life). This edition also has a bunch of guest artists. \\n The saint of killers read like a spaghetti western mashed up with American folklore, along the vein of John Henry or Paul Bunyan. It's even written as a story told orally to a modern day hitman. Really enjoyed this one, and the art by Pugh and Ezquerra was an interesting change of pace. Pugh's work reminded me of carved wood prints, and had a lot of interesting textures. Occasionally the faces seemed a bit characatureish but I liked them. The Ezquerra issue was nice in a different way, with a lot of creepy aspects to his vision of hell. His artwork overall seemed very scratchy. \\n Arseface's origin was a bit of a coming of age story, to some degree, though it just showed a bit of his downward spiral. This set was illustrated by Richard Case. His work has high contrast, with a lot of dark areas, and strong angled lines. It was good, but probably my least favorite of the book. His story is definitely a depressing one and it shows more of how much of a horrible person Sheriff Hugo Root is. The main arc of Arseface's character is that he learns to take responsibility for his actions, though he is a pretty stupid guy in general. \\n The last section with Jody and T.C. reads like a cheezy 80s action movie, particularly the side characters. The cop on the edge and the reporter with a secret cliche followed by the over-the-top international terrorist is played off brilliantly. The story shows just how nasty, but badass Jody is, particularly in a bloody bashing of a gorilla. The artwork is handled again by Ezquerra. \\n There is a particularly high amount of swearing in this book (not that there isn't much in any of the others, but this one seemed particularly high). There are some very bloody sections, in all three storylines. Overall, good writing that almost seemed a little experimental built on established tropes. Good stuff.\"),\n",

Embedded in each issue are their respective past lives as celebrated superheroes, decade-old memories of their JLA/Avenger-ish exploits.

It gives closure to crossover issues while still allowing them to be important. Unfortunately, this points out a flaw of this particular collection of Millennium. Without all of those crossovers, the story is definitely fragmentary. Engelhart does his best to tell you what went on, but sometimes there's just not enough room for everything.

The lady at the counter recommended this one today and it is probably the most fun I have had whilst reading a comic. \\n Following on from the awesome comic cover which sold it to me if the recommendation by the attractive store clerk was not enough, this story follows assassin, avenger, mercenary and smelly person Deadpool, and also the elegantly titled Howard the Duck. He was hatched in Duckworld but now is a private detective for hire. If this doesn\\'t sound kooky enough so far - well, Deadpool\\'s inner monologue, what he calls a spirit animal, is Wolverine and they discuss furniture and decor. Also, Rocket from Guardians of the Galaxy just seems \"off his tits\" on some drug or mind trip. The twenty-two pages here fly by. The humour is very tongue in cheek. You can see the two different art styles incorporated by Jacopo Camagni when the two stars of this five episode series are separate yet when they cross paths it is a combination of the two before the ultimate ending where we meet Deadpool the Duck after some chaotic, bizarre, scientific and nonsensical chain of events. This was a quick, immensely enjoyable narrative and I will follow the series going forwards. James x'),\n",

       "  'Instead of going grand like its other Crisis siblings, Identity Crisis goes deep. And it hurts. \\n Elongated Man\\'s wife is murdered and someone has to pay for it. As the superheroes find out the person responsible, filthy secrets about our beloved characters are laid bare. Brad Meltzer has effectively humanized many DC heroes and villains, putting them in a situation where their superpowers are close to being useless and playing with their emotions as if you were reading a novelized drama anthology. \\n Dirty things happen and are uncovered in Identity Crisis. For one, there is rape. I personally don\\'t like a rape scene in any story. The rapture of female divinity is almost always present in these so-called \"mature\" stories mainly for its shock value. If not for its great and immersive story, I\\'d give Identity Crisis a one-star. Then there are other things like morally questionable decisions, deaths and other devastating repercussions, it\\'s a Crisis event in the first place. \\n Speaking of an immersive story, this one is page-turner. This collected edition is filled with mystery, red herrings and plot twists. The little details in the dialogue and facial expressions give the characters a sort of dark vibrancy. There are some chapters that shine above the rest like the issue about fathers. \\n I agree with you, Rags Morales. This is my personal best emotional panel in Identity Crisis. \\n Rags Morales\\' facial artwork and close-up panels do the trick in emphasizing emotional distress. This close-up technique is even present in fight scenes and I love the claustrophobic feel it gives. The Deathstroke vs. all gruesome fight scene deserves a standing ovation. \\n Thank you, Deathstroke for this insanely delicious one-versus-JSA fight. \\n Identity Crisis is a must-read for DC fans. Be prepared though for there are things you cannot unread. The end may be a bit corny and shallow but overall it is great in a grim way.'),\n",

       "  \"*Some Spoilers* \\n How do we approach this graphic, very graphic, novel? As a consistent continuation of the ouevre of Alan Moore? As an investigation of the pornographic? Or as a subliminal political tract? \\n Let us start with Moore because this text is recognisably within his style. Artists may come and go but Moore's themes are often those of the power of imagination to cast new light on the world. \\n Much of his earlier work involved alternate futures and histories - the dystopia of Thatcher's Britain in 'Skizz', a fascist Britain of 'V for Vendetta' and the world where Nixon won the election in 'Watchmen'. \\n Later work overlays this with a game of memes set around a grand theme - magic and the esoteric in the magnificent 'Promethea' series and popular literary figures in the finely tuned but sometimes disappointing 'League of Extraordinary Gentlemen' series. \\n 'Lost Girls' takes the theme of pornographic literature and cross-fertilises it transgressively with three seminal (excuse these puns) children's stories about girls written by men - Alice in Wonderland, Peter Pan and The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. \\n Alice is older and a lesbian defensively avoiding men, Dorothy is an up-front American flirt and Wendy is the repressed wife of an equally repressed and shatteringly dull British businessman. \\n The whole is set at a point of maximum decadence - Austria-Hungary in the days before the First World War - and Moore's words are set to brilliant pastiches of the erotic art of the preceding decades: the cards of Becat, Von Bayros, Mucha, Schiele and more. \\n He has found a superb artistic collaborator in Melinda Gebbie who has not flinched from the subject matter - my initial irritation with the girlish soft-hued pastel shades collapsed before the skill of her interpretations and versatility. \\n But be in no doubt - the pictures and text are 'pornographic' in the most extreme way and there is no let up in it. As in all pornographic material, the story seems thin (three women tell stories of their past in a hotel on the eve of war) so that couplings and multiple copulations can be effected without too much distraction. \\n Of course, Moore is cleverer than this. The story is, in fact, sophisticated with its investigations of the difference between fantasy and reality even if it slips into cliche with the 1914 theme by the end. \\n The casual reader must understand in advance that this is not just the graphic presentation of sexuality but the sexuality of the histories of the young girls who became women, of fantasies of incest and exploitation and of the most callous Sadean activity. \\n Each of the children's stories is subverted into a tale of simultaneous pleasure, extremity and both willing and unwilling exploitation. \\n Alice is a victim of child abuse who becomes a sexual addict dragged into orgies, drugs and prostitution by a lesbian 'set' of singular obsessive cruelty. \\n Dorothy discovers masturbation and sex on the farm and effectively half-seduces and is half-victim of a seriously abusive father. On the way there, she happily masturbates a horse while being anally buggered. \\n Wendy is 'perverted' by street urchins who provide sexual services for middle class men when they are not engaged in sexual activity among themselves. This 'Tinkerbelle' is the sexual plaything of her brother, Peter, giving more cause to the jealousy in the story than Disney scriptwriters had managed. \\n Incest is a central theme of the book - fantasies of every form of coupling (though minimally male homosexual) express a vision of the family dynamic which nods to Freud but which, in fact, is simply a play on one central theme: how is it that we both have such desires and control or repress them so effectively. \\n Which is where we come to an implicit politic because Moore's position seems to be that civilisation depends on the maintenance of the separate realm of a free imagination which is uncontrolled. \\n It is the pornographic extremities of the imaginative realm that act as an outlet for the repressive miseries and potential for violence and exploitation seen in the girl's 'real' stories and in the onset of war. \\n This is not an easy argument for many people to understand. For them, the map of literature or art is the territory of real life and social relations. They cannot 'get' that the imaginal realm is 'other'. \\n It is the same flaw in thinking that makes God a real presence in people's lives or has the same imagined creature judging an act from within. \\n The inability to understand that these are two different realms is what results in the 'politics of disgust', the attempts to repress desire and the failure to deal with acts of exploitation when they appear. \\n Child abuse is a general theme within the book. It is expressed graphically and often. Moore intelligently avoids the black and white interpretation where some evil adult seduces the innocent in favour of something more ambiguous and true to life. What is going on is a trading of desires and power which are enabled by secrecy and denial. \\n Another theme is the fact that the girls are lost because no one talks about desire in their world of innocence, things are done in secret and the girls are left to fend for themselves and work out mysteries that are imposed on them by circumstance - whether stuck on a Kansas farm or in an English middle class household. \\n This sophisticated and multifaceted work raises the essence of the problem behind social control and repression of sexual desire, one which appears to have passed by the Christians and feminists who encircle our unimaginative Prime Minister. \\n Pornography as cause of sexual crime is simply special pleading by the criminal. The expression of erotic fantasy for most people most of the time is a liberation of desire and violence precisely so that it does not act in the world. It is a salve. It may even be a form of salvation. \\n Sexual pleasure and even transgression between adults 'works through' the system so that exploitation and abuse remain in the literature and the art and do not leach out into the real world. \\n Attempts to control the imagery of desire drives what cannot be obliterated not merely underground but into vicious corners where the imagined may become real - as in rural child abuse, predatory sexual abuse of urban minors and systems of economic sexual exploitation. \\n All the pornographic styles and stories in the book arise out of an age of repressed expression of desire but are part of the solution and not part of the problem. \\n The problem lies elsewhere - not in a fascination with the sexual, masturbation or curiosity but with social structures that make all these normal interests out to be 'deviant' or 'perverted'. \\n The 'lost girls', on the other hand, are all exploited and abused not because they are sexual beings but because they are sexual beings without power to express their sexuality on their own terms. \\n Alice is, in fact, not permitted just to be a lesbian but must enter a sub-culture that is vicious. Dorothy is a highly sexual creature who just wants to experiment on equal terms with men. Wendy has sexual desires but is forced by circumstance into danger or total denial and ends up with an apparently a-sexual bore who turns out to be a submissive gay. \\n But it is even more complicated than this. Alice is not in control of her history and is even a little predatory towards Dorothy and Wendy but Dorothy and Wendy, as adults, embrace the predation. \\n Dorothy avoids to the end the admission that her sexual affair was with her father but she is not traumatised by it, merely avoiding discussion of a social taboo where she was actually in more (though not complete) control than we might like. \\n Her complaint is not of abuse but of having to continue a very run-of-the-mill sexual relationship after the transgressional glamour of a trip to the big city. She feels sorry, in the end, for her step-mother in a very true-to-life female reaction. \\n Wendy's childish familial incest is pushed aside in horror when the games go wrong and she is threatened with rape in woodland by a paedophile as she turns from child to woman - but the horror results in decades of unhappiness until liberated by her new 'sisters'. \\n The event is also not one of a victim either. She turns on the bully and uses words to whip lash him into humiliated withdrawal - she has become empowered under extreme pressure. \\n In short, both Moore and Gebbie (and we are reminded that the graphic images are all produced by a woman) are reminding us that sex-positivity is more complicated than the 'victim' mentality imposed on us by our current culture. \\n These ambiguities do not belong to society but to the individuals who are free to react in multiple ways - relaxed acceptance and complicity, defensive resistance or denial and unhappiness after a moment of empowered epiphany - and that any responses that may result in a personal transformation equally belong to individuals and not society. \\n If Alice brings Wendy's sexuality back to life, there is no suggestion that her life between the rape attempt and her new friendships was a lie but rather that it had served its purpose for both Mr. and Mrs Potter and now it was time to move on. \\n The men in the story are mostly all sad, lonely and weak characters - furtive child abusers, repressed homosexuals, men coming to terms with their own sexuality through strategies of denial, men who are thrown aside at their moment of transformation, secretive men, dead militarist men. \\n In the end, there is no real conclusion to the book. You either share a general position of sex-positivity and triumph over abuse as the best 'normal' way of things or you will be, frankly, confused, 'disgusted' and even horrified. \\n If the latter, then you have done something that Moore is warning us against - confused imagination for reality and failed to see imagination not as an expression of actual intent in the world but as a tool for internal transformation of the person who exists within that world. \\n Perhaps our Prime Minister and his somewhat dim-witted advisers will finally get it. A free imagination does not cause criminality or abuse, criminals and abusers do crimes and abuse and such crimes and abuses arise not from pornography but from a lack of imagination in using pornography as a tool. \\n The sexual imagination, like the Japanese and American imaginative flirtations with violence, is an inoculation against excess in a world that is stupid, brutal and cruel. The good society requires it because we are human animals in this world, not castrated saints in the making for the next. \\n Our sexual desire is central to who we are even when we deny it or it is absent and because we, not an abstraction, are central to the social, sexuality is best accommodated in a positive way and not as a furtive business of misery and guilt.\"),\n",

As of right now I am unsure of how they are going to get rid of this rather large problem. \\n Red Skull as a villain is always a blast.

While we are watching cats and mice and pigs interact, these characters feel more human than any other holocaust narrative I have come across. I would preferred if it was visually more inventive and dynamic. It was a little basic for me. But in every other area, Art Spiegelman uses more than just a few creative devices, reinvigorating what otherwise could have been a band, heartless, grotesque narrative. \\n If you are new to the graphic novel or do not think of it as a legitimate genre of literature, then read this.

       "  \"The first story in this volume is really a coda to the plots of volume 3, and that's a darned shame because it's a strong story that loses a lot of its dramatic impact by being separated from the goings-on in Washington that occurred previously. This story (Suicide Squad #26) is only in this volume for one panel (that'd be page 4, panel 6), which is a setup to the Janus Directive, and I think that was the wrong choice. \\n As for the Janus Directive itself: it's got a superb foundation. It's about the main government super agencies and forces of the late '80s: the Suicide Squad, Checkmate, Project Atom, Peacemaker, and the little-known Force of July, who'd originated in The Outsiders. It's about a conflict between them and what arises from that. \\n Unfortunately, the plot is bady focused. Though the comic constantly talks about how the Janus Directive is a conflict between these agencies, that conflict really ends quite quickly, after just a few issues. After that, the plot does a lot of meandering before the final fight with the villain behind everything (who also doesn't seem as important to the overall story as he should be). \\n In addition, few of the comics hold up to the quality of Suicide Squad's writing at the time. Checkmate, which takes up about half the volume is just plain dull. I think a lot of the problem is that the Knights all seem faceless, so we're robbed of any characterization. Meanwhile some of the other comics like Firestorm and Captain Atom are so involved in their own plots that they don't mesh well with the overall storyline. Even Suicide Squad is damaged by this crossover. There are occasional good moments, but a lot of the comic's unique characterization and plotting are lost by the crossover's constant fighting. \\n Overall, this volume is a severe disappointment when compared to the previous three, and it's also sad that what could have been an interesting crossover turns out to be too poor plotted and too dragged down by inferior books to be worth much.\"),\n",

It\\'s the supporting cast that really makes the issue, particularly the kids [7+/10]. \\n Kelco (254-256). These three issues feature a trial against Kelco Chemicals which on the one hand is very fascinating because it\\'s a proxy fight between Matt and the Kingpin and on the other hand is very frustrating because Nocenti keeps applying the rules of criminal trials (\"reasonable doubt\", \"unanimous jury\") to a civil case. It\\'s very hard to like a storyline where the author hasn\\'t done the barest research, even though it\\'s a good case that really goes to Matt\\'s heart. \\n And these issues of course also introduce Typhoid Mary. Her powers are a little ill-defined and she\\'s a little too prone to beat-the-hero-because-the-plot-says-to plotting. But her interactions with Daredevil and Mary\\'s interactions with Matt form a beautiful and interesting little triangle [6+/10]. \\n Shorts (257-258+P10). A crossover with the Punisher doesn\\'t manage to say much interesting about either character, then a fill-in about Vietnam is decent enough, but stands out for derailing the continuing plot. [4/10]. \\n The Final Triumph of Typhoid Mary (259-261). Thirty years later, you might not realize how innovative this next sequence is. First, Typhoid attacks Daredevil with a whole series of villains, then when Daredevil is missing, presumed dead, the Human Torch takes over the title. We\\'ve seen both of these plot tropes elsewhere, but not so much in 1988. The sequential attack of so many wacky villains is still breath-taking, and the placement of the Torch in Daredevil\\'s world is everything that the Punisher crossover wasn\\'t ... and a nice piece of tense wheelspinning while we wait for what\\'s next. [7+/10] \\n What\\'s surprising is that what\\'s next is ... \\n Inferno (262-263, 265). Nocenti rather nicely dovetails together Typhoid Mary and Daredevil. On the one hand she uses Mary to create repercussions for Matt\\'s personal life and on the other hand she uses Inferno to create repercussions for Kingpin\\'s personal life. It\\'s a nice balancing act that feels very organic. Unfortunately, the latter parts of these issues show off the worst elements of the Inferno crossover: mindless battles against inanimate objects and demons. So what started out as a tense interpersonal tale quickly becomes a dull crossover event [5/10]. \\n Baby Boom (264). This out of sequence story is a crazy bit of silliness, appropriately illustrated by Steve Ditko [6/10]. \\n On the Road (266-270). The shorts that Nocenti ends the book with suggest that she may very well do best with that form. The first three -- another Christmas story, a meeting with a villain, and an interaction with some small-time criminals -- are all superb, primarily for the very human people that Matt interacts with. The last two, featuring Freedom Force and a devil, are less interesting because they\\'re big fights, but they\\'re still decently good. Overall, these are among the best stories in the volume because of their tightness and their human focus [7+/10]. \\n I haven\\'t liked most of what I\\'ve read from Nocenti, and I\\'ve never understood the acclaim she gets from some. This volume better explains it because it\\'s very strong Daredevil writing, backed up by great art, mostly by Romita Jr. Yeah, it\\'s no Miller or Bendis or even Brubaker, but it\\'s still a strong Daredevil run.'),\n",

There is definitely a lot of adolescent humor and style to it, but that was ok. It made the quite serious undertones a little less...serious. The characters weren't terribly deep, as this was much more plot driven.

A haunting story, and a nice character piece for Warren, but ultimately a somewhat shallow story, and one that\\'s not helped by the sketchy black-and-white art, which feels very unfinished [6/10]. \\n Brood: Day of Wrath. I wasn\\'t a fan of all the interruptions to the core plot line in the previous volume, and that\\'s continuing on here. Still, this was a nice sequel to the second Brood saga, way back in Claremont\\'s days. The fights went on too long, particularly in the second issue, but otherwise this is a great human story and a nice look at the Brood [6+/10]. Sadly, it looks like the unresolved ending to this story was never closed. \\n Beast (XMU 10). I\\'ve mostly hated these X-Men Unlimiteds, which have been stretched-out stories of no importance to the rest of the X-verse. This one was the exception. Waid is a good writer and it shows here as we get great background on McCoy, a sinister villain, and a shocking ending. And, it even ties in to the main X-Men comics. Yay! [7+/10]. \\n Onslaught (XM50). Given that it\\'s a big fight against Post, this is a fairly interesting issue. That\\'s probably in part due to seeing the interactions of the small team of Scott, Ororo, Bobby, and Logan, and in part due to having the mystery of Onslaught front and forward [6+/10]. \\n Iceman (UXM 331). Another nice character issue. There were a shocking number of these in the pre-Onslaught days! This one puts a good spotlight on Bobby (and Emma) [7+/10]. \\n No-Nose (UXM332,W101). To start with, this story began in Wolverine #100, which isn\\'t collected, so we get an incomplete view of things. Then, \"feral Wolveirne\" was one of the most incredibly stupid ideas of the \\'90s, not least because he looks like his parody self from UXM #153 (Fiend-With-No-Name). And finally, most of these two issues are pointless fight. There are some neat hints about Apocalypse, but it\\'s not nearly enough to carry this story [3/10]. \\n Death Train (XM51-52). The last few issues include a boring fight aboard a \"death train\", a ridiculously complex method to resolve the problem, and some fun interaction with Mr. Sinister. I\\'d hoped for a bit more with Mark Waid coming aboard, but this is nonetheless an OK story [6/10]. \\n On the whole, this is better than vol. 2 of Road to Onslaught because it\\'s a less fractured story (despite the Brood and noseless Wolverine digressions) that\\'s full of lots of nice character bits, which is what X-Men excelled at in the \\'80s. However too many of the stories wobble towards mediocrity for it quite to reach the heights of vol. 1. Still, it\\'s not nearly as bad as you hear X-Men of the \\'90s was!'),\n",

Though there are 3 that I need to find translations for, otherwise at least 2 of those are completed but in my library they're still ongoing. Why do I love this mangaka's works so much that I can reread them for as many times as I want to without getting bored? Her drawing style is great, her plots are fun and simple and her characters are always developed and with a great sense of humor. \\n In Get Love, I laughed on nearly every page. Just the concept of a short guy is already fun, but the author takes it up even higher and presents a fantastic character in Yuuki. During all 7 volumes, he's short and only on last [ages he finally is high and it's a bit annoying because it would have been so great to see him a bit more. Miki is a character that you love from the very first glance. She's fun, she's cheerful and she's a bit perverted, and the best part - she's the greatest Yuuki Sagara's fan. Her love for him is something amazing. The story progresses fast for a shoujo, a bit too fast. They're a couple before the first volume ends. But besides the relationship problems and those are so many not so many, but quite a lot, Miki and Yuuki face some major problems, like a formidable opponent in football and it's always fun to watch how Miki is cosplaying in order for the team to practice harder.the humor in this story is fantastic. And I've mentioned this but drawing style is specific but amazing. The characters feel not drawn but real like they'll jump right from the pages and start talking to you.

I wanted to know who Tars Tarkas or (the incomparable) Dejah Thoris was, of course, but Carter\\'s struggle against the Holy Therns and the Black Pirates took center stage. \\n I think A Princess of Mars Barsoom 1 was actually the third or fourth Barsoom book I read. \\n And I\\'ve never read any of the Tarzan, Pellucidar or Venus novels or any of the other fantastical worlds Burroughs could create. \\n What drew me to John Carter was the image of Mars ERB created: An ancient, dying civilization populated by a menagerie of interesting people and beasts.

(Meg is Kim's teenage granddaughter) I'm giving this four stars rather than three because I'm aware that a) I would have appreciated it more if I had seen the movie before and b) I recognize that my opinion about the pace is based on personal preference.\"),\n",

       "  '\"Okay. But... Batman... I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship\" - The Joker \\n This is the second comic from the Brian Azzarello and Matteo Casali\\'s Batman Europa series. Batman and the Joker find themselves in Prague, both infected with a deadly virus that they are working together to find the cure for. They are being hunted around the town by a number of mechanical controlled monstrosities some reminiscent of the droogs from Clockwork Orange. Batmans\\' other accomplice Nina gets kidnapped and the adventure takes them on to the next step. They are looking for the mysterious villain known as the Trojan Horse, who poisoned the two anti-heroes and hoping to find Nina. Giuseppe Camuncoli\\'s artwork is pretty intense with many close ups of grimaces and growls as Batman battles whoever is placed in front of him whilst his disease is worsening. It focuses a lot on the Jokers\\' eyes and Batmans\\' white voids where his eyes should be behind his mask. The language to support the action is often quite simple but you can easily see the personalities of Joker and Batman shining through the text. A mutual respect is perhaps building between these legends of DC comics, too. This was a very cool, quick read. I honestly don\\'t know too much about comics. I was tempted into an awesome looking comic book shop today and thought I would check them out. This gets a solid three stars and when I am more familiar with comics, I may change that rating to reflect what I hope will be a belated healthy relationship with comic books. \\n James'),\n",

However, it never loses its charm to me. \\n When I first read the story, it had a really big impact on me. I really loved both characters. It may have been only about 20 or so pages, but you could see that character development. I really am a fan of Takagi Shegeyoshi's works; I think I've read everything I could get my hand on. You can't say that his drawing style is that amazing, but all of his characters have this sharp facial features and you may seem they are extremely cold, but then they either smile or open their eyes and warmth is spreading all over the page and you. It is quite an amazing feeling. \\n The last pages of the story are quite heartbreaking, though it does end happily there is a question regarding the relationship between the main characters. For me, it didn't seem that he really accepted her feelings or something, neither did he stated his own, but well, he did say that from now on she has to read books aloud to him. The story mostly follows the Yae's point of view and we do not really see the pain that Ayase feels, however when he tells Yae his secret, everything can be seen through his bittersweet smile. It's really heartbreaking, well it was for me. I do encourage you to read this short story, it really is amazing. Enjoy it and if you do read it, please share your thoughts with me. \\n XOXO \\n Katie\"),\n",

Unfortunately the lacklustre humour and predictable narrative make this book a lot more cliche than the Arthurian tales it's attempting to parody. \\n Looking For Group is written by Ryan Sohmer and features a group of characters that seem to be ripped right out of World of Warcraft. At the group's centre is Cale, an elven adventurer who just wants to be the hero, despite the fact his race is entirely evil. At his side from the beginning is Richard, an undead warlock with a penchant for murder and mayhem. \\n As they move through the narrative on Cale's quest to become the ultimate hero, they are joined by a cast of characters who can only be described as a group of convenience, since they don't really seem to like each other or agree on anything. \\n Much of the humour is rooted in the world of online gaming, making fun of tropes in lore and character development. For someone who doesn't play online games, Sohmer's writing would probably appear fresh. But in truth, anyone who has experienced these games is probably familiar with all of these jokes. \\n Lar deSouza's art progresses as you read through the first volume, making it very obvious that this was an online comic before it was a collected work. The art is decent, though at times the colour palette seems a little too bright. It is very cartoony and some of the earlier pages appear a bit messy, but overall I thought the art fit well with the fun nature of the plot. \\n I'm very limited in who I could recommend this to.

He was thoroughly domesticated, and so no longer the character that had won his popularity in the X-Men. Millar changed that with a simple twist: he made Wolverine into a villain. Now other writers, past and present, have tried this route to his little success. But Millar made it believable and total with Hand brainwashing, and the result is one of the best Wolverine saga ever. \\n Wolverine is a beast again, a force of nature. He goes toe-to-toe with Marvel's best, and even against foes like The Thing, the outcome is in question. Now you can't maintain this status quo for too long without it getting stale, and Millar knows when to stop. But then he pulls a great trick: even when Wolverine is back on the side of angels, he remains that unstoppable force of nature. It's like a trip to the dark side has returned Wolverine's essential self. \\n To a large extent this story isn't deep. But it's action-adventure at its best. I'm often not a fan of the extended battle sequences, but Millar manages to maintain their tension by creating a story of things gone horribly wrong where anything could happen. \\n And these issues also have Romita artwork to die for! [8/10] \\n I'm also impressed by how much this arc now feels like a setup for the Secret Warriors comic. \\n Prisoner Number Zero (32). a nice little one-off that feels more like a ghost story than anything else. I'm not convinced it's a great Wolverine comic, but it is a good book to read [7/10]. \\n Old Man Logan (66-72 + GS). Millar does a good job of creating a fun and evocative world, mixing Mad Max-style post-apocalyptic with western theming. We've certainly seen many variants of the post-superhuman future, but this one is memorable nonetheless. \\n However, there's only so far that evocative backgrounds can take you in a story that's essentially a one-trick pony. Wolverine has become a pacifist. Does he SNIKT the claws or doesn't he? The road trip that's the alleged plot of the story is really just a long tease for that (with one great issue in the middle: what turned Wolverine into a pacifist?), and it gets a bit old before the resolution. \\n Still, an enjoyable comic.

       "  'The Devil in Cell Block D (82-87). Brubaker picks up right where Bendis left off, and gives us a terrific Daredevil-in-jail story. We get Daredevil and many of his arch-foes in tight confines. We get an FBI that is truly @(#*ing with him. We get marvelous characterization as Matt circles down into despair and rage. We get a few shocking events. And on the outside we get a great supporting cast and a fun mystery. (Who is the duplicate Daredevil?) Overall, a great story and a great start to Brubaker\\'s run. Oh, and there\\'s great dark and moody art by Lark. [8/10]. \\n The Secret Life of Foggy Nelson (88). So Foggy\\'s actually not dead. We found that out in the closing panels of #87. And, good thing. Killing another one of Matt\\'s closest friends would just be a bridge too far. The explanation in this issue is good and believable, but beyond it\\'s not very exciting. Call it an intermission, I guess, between \"The Devil in Cell Block D\" and \"The Devil Takes a Ride\", which were later seen as a single unit [5/10]. \\n The Devil Takes a Ride (89-93). The contrast to Matt behind bars is clearly Matt on a world tour ... but I\\'m not convinced that it\\'s a good contrast as it takes Matt away from his familiar haunts and plays him like a pawn as he shuttles from place to place. Still, the last few issues make up for any deficiencies in this story by offering a great solution to the questions of Brubaker\\'s first year of Daredevil and a very impactful change for one of Matt\\'s major relationships [7/10]. \\n Our Love Story (94). Unlike the Foggy spotlight in the previous volume, this one offers a very strong insight into one of Matt\\'s supporting cast, Milla. It\\'s a great look into who she is and how she views their relationship [7+/10]. \\n The Devil, His Due (95-99). So Brubaker hit a big reset button at the end of his previous arc. Matt is out of jail, Foggy is back, and they\\'re practicing law again. That could have been annoying if not for the fact that Brubake continues to play up the state of Daredevil and how we got here: Matt is still unmasked, and we\\'ve still got problems rolling over form his most recent conflict. \\n As for the plot, that\\'s an intriguing mystery involving a long-time supporting character, Melvin, The Gladiator. It\\'s well laid-out as an unwinding mystery of the type that Brubaker excels out. But, Brubaker doesn\\'t let that get in the way of characters, and so we get some great focus on Matt, Milla, and others along the way. \\n The only deficit of this arc is that it doesn\\'t end. Oh, there\\'s a clear break at the end of #99, but Brubaker is obviously telling another year-long arc, and this one is less differentiated than the one before it. Nonetheless, he gives us some great revelations and shocking events as this part of the arc concludes, resulting in a story that\\'s not quite as good as his introductory arc, but almost there, and strong for many of the same reasons -- including great artwork, great characters, strong plotting, and good use of continuity [8/10]. \\n Without Fear (100-105). Here\\'s a great idea for Daredevil #100: hit Matt with a hallucinatory fear drug, and then have him spend the issue fighting old foes and meeting old lovers and friends, as he trips his way across Hell\\'s Kitchen. It lets you touch back on the continuity of the entire comic\\'s run, and so honor the anniversary. Except, it turns out that this idea has never been interesting and isn\\'t interesting here either. Instead, you get a dull and pointless issue. Worse, this particular usage makes you question why Matt\\'s poisoning worked different from Melvin\\'s poisoning. (Different drugs, I guess, but it\\'s never clarified.) \\n Fortunately, the rest of the volume is great. Brubaker reinvents Mr. Fear as a Killgrave-level manipulator and creates a compelling drama, particularly for the heart-breaking ways that it impacts Matt\\'s life. I said of Brubaker\\'s initial arc that I didn\\'t want to see another repeat of the killing of Matt\\'s friends, but what Brubaker does here is so much better (and worse!). It\\'s also pretty great that Brubaker interweaves his plot with the Dark Reign plotline, but through the use of the Hood he makes it totally organic: a real part of the overall storyline. \\n In the end, Brubaker offers up another excellent volume. Though he\\'s still never matched the excellence of his prison arc, as a whole his second year\\'s story is more consistently great than the first year\\'s story was [8/10].'),\n",

       "  \"This volume combines the latter half of v2 of the Invisibles and all of v3. Although v2 continues up to the Invisibles strengths, v3 unfortunately fizzles out a little, between the Invisibles being broken up, then largely taken off stage. Meanwhile, the comic mainly treads water over v3, until things explode at the end. So, as a whole, this volume is definitely less successful than what came before. \\n Beginnings (14-16). This final volume starts off slowly, with the initial stories (14-16) mainly focusing on characterization and character development. Quimper nicely ups the tension, as does the opposition's mental trickery, but this is the calm before the storm. Despite its character focus and slow action, these initial issues are entirely enthralling, thanks to what a great job Morrison has done on building up these characters over multiple volumes [7+/10]. \\n Black Science 2 (17-20). A delightful set of double and triple crosses. Certainly, it's the same story (yet again) of the Invisibles attacking another opposition base, but it's told so well, particularly in the last few issues as a lot of threads come together, that you don't mind. [7+/10] \\n All Tomorrow's Parties (21). Exit one of my favorite characters. (Sigh.) However, this is a very nice bookend to the time travel stories we've been getting throughout the series [7+/10]. \\n The Tower (22). The Tower in the title is the 16th trump of the Tarot deck. It represents change (and destruction and liberation) and that's what the issue is about. It's mostly just a moving around of chairs, setting us up for the final volume, just as things changed in preparation for it. That leaves it as largely a bridge issue [6/10]. \\n Satanstorm (12-9). I find this first story of the final volume of The Invisibles a bit off-putting. The problem is the focus on characters other than our protagonists, especially since what they're doing is so weird and mysterious. Everything comes together in the end, and their story actually turns out to be pretty brilliant. Meanwhile, Morrison starts bringing together all his plots. But the wrong foot at the start is an awkward beginning [6+/10] \\n KArmageddon (8-5). This is an unfortunate bit of wheel-spinning before the end. I guess it's nice to see the end of Edith's story, but beyond that the plot lines advance at a glacial race, and then there's the issue-long sex diversion (8) which feels entirely irrelevant. [5/10]. \\n The Invisible Kingdom (4-2). Our long-awaited conclusion. This finally puts into motion the plots that were on hold throughout too much of v3. It's a good ending, except it goes a little too esoteric at the end. (Ha! Could it do otherwise?) [6+/10] \\n Glitterdammurung (1). A final issue of course had to cover the next twelves years, and Morrison of course had to offer it up in a fractured modernist way.

This choice to make the characters an animal is an interesting one. Bunnies are most easily identified by their ears. Since this is a book about a person who is deaf moving about in the hearing world, this choice makes sense. It brings a subconscious understanding of how major this difference is to Cece. The thing that sets her apart is big and out there, and she needs to be able to figure out how it makes her more special than a freak. If this was a straight piece of nonfiction, without the graphic element, this subconscious experience would be sorely missed. \\n Nonfiction memoirs work best when they are chronological and focus in on a single event or idea.

What Carlo Vergara did is to combine cliches, slapstick, chauvinism, popular culture references, gay chorvaness, basag-drama antics, sexual innuendos and stereotypical personas into a creation which is downright hilarious. Ang Kagila-gilalas na Pakikipagsapalaran ni Zsazsa Zaturnnah does not just give a bang. It gives a bonggang-bonggang tarusshabang worthy of five flangganahstars. \\n Almost everything in Zaturnnah is familiar. Zaturnnah for one is Darna gay-ified. The voluptuous and booby protagonist is the alter-ego of Ada, a gay beautician who must swallow an oversized meteorite in order to become her. Reading the graphic novel is like watching a typical Filipino movie. You will hear the familiar voice of the protagonist narrating introductions at the opening sequence and life\\'s lessons in the final panels. The punchline styles are not uncommon as well. For example, seemingly melodramatic scenes end up with combo-breaker \"banats\". Familiar setting, familiar reactions. So why is Zaturnnah funny? Two reasons. First, Carlo Vergara simply did it so well. Second, there are things which the written (comic) medium can execute brilliantly as compared with its live-action counterpart. \\n The artwork is just, wow. There may be panel inconsistencies and skips from time to time, but everything is forgiven because Zaturnnah is one hell of an artwork. The fight with the Amazonistas deserves an standing ovation. It displays Vergara\\'s remarkable talent in action storytelling. \\n Certain themes in Zsazsa Zaturnnah can be investigated for intellectual discourse. The most obvious of which is Ada being gay. Vergara gave suggestions of the marginalization of gay people in the society with the conversation of Didi and Ada right before his first transformation to Zaturnnah. The material also goes right into homosexual relationships. Up to a certain degree, one could also see themes on male opression and women empowerment as depicted in the tragic fate of planet X(XXxx...) and the Amazonista\\'s struggle against the male-forms. But let me say that you should forget about these and take Zaturnnah as a reading material solely for leisure and entertainment. Just read it as it is, and you are going to love it right away. \\n Laugh all the way with Zsazsa Zaturnnah. Everybody deserves to be entertained.'),\n",

A pretty light caper story that\\'s fun but little more [7/10]. \\n Relentless (12-16). A phenomenal story, all the better for the fact that Brubaker is able to carry out some extreme tension over the entire five-issue arc. This one is brutal, shocking, and surprising. It\\'s got a wonderful, hopeless noir feel to it, offers some interesting changes for the characters, and is obsessively readable. Definitely the best arc in Catwoman to date [9/10]. \\n No Easy Way Down (17-19). This is an entirely amazing story. It\\'s just about three people fighting through loss and trauma, and what they do and how they cope with it. Brubaker\\'s decision to make this story into three narratives that focus on short stories gives it a lot of its power, but so do the very human and believable reactions that those stories include [10/10!!]. \\n Joy Ride (20-24). A light-hearted close to the volume. This is a fun tour of the cities of the DC Universe. It has its moments of humor, and it offers some nice closure finally the harshness of issues 12-19 [7+/10]. \\n DC Secret Files 2. A fair intro piece on Catwoman, though the \"Why Isn\\'t Holly Dead?\" two-pager is great. The only problem with this comic is that the editor mysteriously decided to put it out of chronology in the volume. It clearly should go before \"Relentless\". As is, its placement is confusing [7/10]. \\n Overall, this is a terrific volume, every bit as good as Brubaker\\'s creator-owned noir comics. Here\\'s to hoping that DC comes through for once and finishes one of their archival series, as I\\'d love to see the mostly uncollected final stories, from 25-37.'),\n",

       "  \"This is one of the funnest comics I've read all year. It is very reminiscent of Scott Pilgrim (to be honest, I haven't read, only saw the movie) in a number of ways. The story revolves around a nerdy freshman that stumbles into a underground spelling bee and then gets roped up into the regionals and nationals by The Outlaw King. It makes these spelling bees into these huge popular spelling bees that are akin to gladiatorial bouts. People have handles, instead of their real name (to avoid unwanted attention from megafans), costumes, and other stuff to turn them into spelling luchadores, essentially. Opponents have names like, The Black Bee, The Beest, Uzi, Psychic, The Immortal, etc. \\n I loved the panelling. The more chaotic the spelling fight, the more chaotic the panels got. The artwork was hard edged and sharp, with black, white, solid greys and a particularly vibrant yellow. The yellow is generally used to point out focus on something, or just to break up the illustration. It isn't my favorite style, but it was suitable for this comic. Another thing I loved was how the letters being spelled would come alive and be used to fight the opponent. Uzi, for instance, rapid fires his letters and they shoot like bullets. One other guy gets mad when he loses, says X and pulls it out of the word bubble to act as a sword. This was really well done throughout and becomes important in a final twist in the end. \\n I would definitely read this one-off book again and it's very kid friendly too.

His new role as a time traveller and a dispenser of Terrigen is rather delightful, and something I wished had remained a plot point, rather than being so swiftly swept under the rug. A decade later, this is also a delightful prelude to IvX, as we get a look at mutant/inhuman relations from long before. [9/10]. \\n X-Men: Deadly Genesis (1-6). This was the beginning of the great Brubaker/Carey X-Men run. It's a strong story, for its secrets and for its action. Vulcan is also a great new character and an answer to a X-Men promise from way back in the '90s. (And a lead-in to the cosmic War of Kings.) However, the real strength of this story going forward was the darkening and humanization of Professor X. This was the story that put things in motion to one day really let the X-Men stand on their own, without their teacher/crutch. At the time, this story was powerful; today, it's pivotal [8/10]. \\n The Silent War (1-6). There are quite a few nice elements to this sequel to Decimation: Son of M. Hine truly seems to understand how to depict the Inhumans as inhumane and he gives us a great plot with important repercussions. It also follows an interesting format, with each issue focused on a different character. However, it doesn't have the strengths of Son of M. We don't get close enough to any character for the story to be grounding, and it's a bit plodding besides [6/10]. \\n Secret Invasion: Inhumans (1-4). A strong Inhumans story because it gives them a galactic scope and because it touches upon their Kree origins. It's also nice to see some serious follow-up to Secret Invasion, an event that in large part ignored what should have been big plot shifts across the Marvel universe. On the downside, the MacGuffin quest of this comic seemed a little staid and easy [7/10]. \\n Guardians: Legacy (1-6). The DnA Guardians of the Galaxy gets off to a shockingly rocky start. The main problem is in the first three issues, which follow a crisis-of-the-month format and are further hindered by an annoying post-mission-report storytelling style that totally destroys momentum in the story. Thankfully, things pick up in the last three issues, which are a great complement to the Secret Invasion event (though some of the final resolution is a bit too cliched). There's also a neat side-plot about the future Guardians which isn't fully explained here, but does get lots of intriguing action [6/10]. \\n Galactus (Nova #13-15). A big fight against the Silver Surfer and a strange being called Harrow. It's got a nice finale, but overall, there's not a lot depth to it [5+/10]. \\n Secret Invasion (Nova #16-18). Nova's return to Earth allows for some nice continuity, including the returns of Nova's brother, Quasar, and the whole of Project Pegasus. But the fact that it's big long fights with skrulls keeps it from attaining too much emotional depth [6/10]. \\n Nova Corps (Nova #19-22). A great shake-up of the status quo, as the last few years of stories pay out with the Nova Corps being (at last) reformed. This is fun world-building, and also offers a nice spotlight on Richard's character, separate from the world mind and the Corps. With all of that going on, it's fun that the best issue of this arc may actually be about Richard's past in the New Warriors, because it ties his whole story into a nice whole [7+/10].\"),\n",

The characters, the place, the life situations that the manga covers are well described and give off strong individuality. Our main characters - Suzuki Tarou and Suzuki Hanako are absolutely amazing. No, they are not siblings; they just have same surname. Those two are plain, four-eyed students, normal average Japanese people (stated in the manga, not my stereotype). \\n They applied to the super elite school, only because the principles of the school influenced them. But, when they get to see that those principles are just words and that in their school bulling is a normal thing, they change themselves according to their role models (yakudza boss-from the movies) and now they will make the Aidan School into the school of their dream. Will they succeed? Start reading now and know it for yourself! \\n I\\'ll be definitely making a second review as soon as the all chapters are available on the site I read on. So today I will be focusing on the \"villain\" of this story - Naoji Dougan. Why did I choose him? If you\\'ve read the manga then you know whom he is. For those who don\\'t: he is the sun of the director couple of the Aidan Academy. He is also acting as the student council president and the model student for the whole academy. Everything would have been amazing, if not his awful attitude towards the school. If in the very beginning and up till chapter 11 he\\'s the awful villain, after that the more you seem to get to know about him the more you understand him and you might even find yourself supporting him. What\\'s his problem? Well, the problem mainly is in his parents, especially in his mother. I don\\'t get her; she just tries to strip him off his personality just to get an heir to the school, how sick is that. When she handcuffed him, and made him color pictures and do origami I couldn\\'t contain my astonishment and I became so team Naoji. Though I do understand his motives, but I just can\\'t support him, mostly due to violence and bulling the core of the changes he tries to make. He makes an amazing character; he\\'s one of those villain characters that are essential to the story. Without such character the story wouldn\\'t have been as great. I really wish to see how his relationship with Ibuki will be going, I so wish those two to end up together for good, and she will make him find his happiness. \\n I hope you\\'ll find some time to read this amazing manga. It is full of nice jokes and life situations; the story is fast paces and very interesting. Next time I review it I\\'ll be focusing on relationships between the characters and of course on our favourite Suzuki Duo. \\n You\\'ll love them really a lot.

       "  \"Herge's 'Adventures of Tintin' are classic 'ligne claire' comic books, representing a type of clear Continental style of draughtsmanship that often contrasts with the moodier styles more recently developed in the US and East Asia. \\n There has been some politically correct criticism of the Tintin adventures, which amount to 24 comic books written from the 1930s to the 1970s (the last unfinished from the early 1980s) - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herg%C3%A9 - but the truth is that the adventures were often the first introduction to the graphic novel in school and public libraries. \\n Only the most po-faced critic would object to the vast bulk of the output. The girl in Forbidden Planet in London who took my money was excited to see that I had bought it because it had introduced her to the world she now worked in. \\n And miserabilists who would edit out all past children's literature because of the political conditions of the day and different sensibilities are insulting kids' intelligence (they soon filter out the objectionable themselves). Worse, denying them access to their own cultural history is a crime because it deprives them of the right to make their own judgements on 'progress'. Captain Haddock is a likeable alcoholic - so what? Likeable alcoholics don't cease to exist because you edit them out of children's history. \\n Tintin in Tibet is the acknowleded classic among classics, missing only the Thompson Twins as characters that include Haddock, Snowy the dog and, of course, the intrepid man-child Tintin himself. \\n What is remarkable, in view of the dominance of fantasy in most contemporary graphic design, is the lack of the fantastic. The world was small enough in 1960 that Tibet could be, in itself, an exoticism - last frontiers such as the Amazon, Space and the Pacific Islands still existed for kids at that time. The story is a succession of classic adventure incidents, any of which could (except for the comical denouement which will not be spoiled by me) have taken place in real life. \\n This is a world closer to Rider Haggard or Henty, upgraded for 'modern' (mid-twentieth century) kids, than it is to the usual fantasy fare of today - but its general humanity (the values are primarily ones of concern for others regardless of cultural origin) and the constant incident still make it perfect for tweenies. \\n Recommended.\"),\n",

But it's still full of original and innovative ideas, particularly for the time [7/10]. \\n Marvel Two-In-One (4-5). The Guardians' return five years later is a sloppy story, primarily because Gerber likes his continuing stories, rather unusually for the time period. Thus we get lots of what was going on at the time in Marvel Two-in-One and very little of the actual Guardians, and what we see is mostly fighting -- which isn't that unusual for the time period. It's good to see the Guardians' new costumes and also to see a pretty epic storyline, but it's not particularly great [5/10]. \\n Defenders (GS5, 26-29). This arc really doesn't start off very encouragingly, with a battle against Eelar, the mutated electric eel (seriously!), but from there it becomes an epic battle for Earth itself. There are also a lot of innovative introductions here, like the young Vance Astro, the Sisterhood of the Badoon, and Starhawk. So, there's a lot to love in what's the Guardians' first really major story [7+/10]. \\n The Gerber Marvel Presents (3-7, 9). After Gerber rather suddenly closes off the Badoon storyline, he moves on to the wacky, psychedelic, drugged-out stories that were more typical of his run on Defenders. They're kind of delightful to see in the outer space setting, but also not as great as more the epic and sensible Badoon stories. The highlight is surely Gerber's last regular issue, which manages to convey exactly the big-picture ideas that he was trying to convey -- though I'm quite happy that he was able to come back and detail part of Starhawk's origin, which was quite interesting too [7/10]. \\n Silver Surfer (8). Ick! Pretty much the definition of a fill-in. Not only does this story not fit into continuity, but as far as I can tell, it's mostly a reprint of an old Silver Surfer story -- and one that wasn't that interesting. I would have preferred they just include the Silver Surfer story back in its appropriate place, and skip this silly frame [4/10]. \\n The Stern Marvel Presents (10-12). Unfortunately, Stern doesn't really keep the strip up to the standards of wackiness and thoughtfulness that Gerber set. The plots aren't nearly as interesting, and often read more like Star Wars than Guardians. I also really didn't like some of the elements: the finale to the origin of Starhawk didn't make much sense; and the conclusion of the kids' storyline felt very disrespectful of what Gerber had set up. I came close to skimming some of these final issues. Nonetheless, it was good to have the conclusion [4/10]. \\n Overall, this is great space adventure of a sort that was likely totally unprecedented at the time. It still holds up well, and Marvel did a really good job of collecting together this storyline from its several major sources.\"),\n",

So naturally, when I learned that it was being adapted into graphic novel form, I had to check it out. \\n Volume 1 of the graphic novel version covers somewhere between the first third and the first half of the story, and does a credible job of it. Some of the smaller details are left out, but they're streamlined well to account for the needs of the medium. Happily, Ardian Syaf's art is a little more solid than in the earlier Dresden graphic novel Welcome to the Jungle, although for my money, the gentleman still needs to work on his ability to draw female faces. Most of the women still look strangely masculine in his style, although Murphy looks more like a blonde Dana Scully now and less like a German beermaid, and that's a step in the right direction--which is to say, towards Butcher's description of Murphy as looking like a cute little cheerleader. \\n Thumbs up though for Syaf's depiction of Harry, which is quite nice and manages to convey Harry as suitably tall without making him particularly bulky. I also very much liked the panels featuring the fairy Toot-Toot, and the fight scene at the end with the demon that tries to attack Harry's apartment is fun (even if it's choregraphed with all sorts of conveniently placed distractions to hide the fact that Harry is stark naked during the whole scene). \\n So yeah, nothing really new here to anyone who's familiar with the story, but it's a fun read nonetheless and worth looking at for any Dresden Files fan.

This title is a team-up between DC\\'s Justice League and The WildC.A.T.S., then published by Image comics. The basic outline of the story is pretty standard fare -- A time-shifting foe is using his abilities to tap into the energies of time and space itself in an attempt to become godlike, leading to ruptures that threaten both universes -- but Grant Morrison does a good job of differentiating the large-ish cast of characters as well as the two universes, particularly given the relatively short amount of pages he has to work with. The art is consistently solid, and everything moves along at a good clip without any major plot threads unraveling. Of course, since this is a crossover between two publishers, by the end all of the major players have been restored pretty much intact to their original states. \\n Really, my biggest complaint is a little unfair. DC was going through one of their periodic attempts to \"refresh\" some of their iconic characters, and Superman in particular is almost unrecognizable throughout the book. That\\'s not the fault of those who gave us this particular title, since they had to work with what they had available, but I nevertheless found myself thinking that if really like to have seen this with the \"real\" Superman in place instead. \\n This is hardly a problem unique to DC, or to that era of comics. I rather suspect that in years to come people may feel the same way about, say, Peter Parker as a rich businessman rather than a working photographer. But I digress. \\n On the whole this was an enjoyable title, and it was fun to see the two teams interact.

This story is gripping and intriguing. Introspect explores what constitutes the identity of Elektra and what happens when you take away her assassin self. It is a story I'm interested in reading in any form in superhero comics, because you are throwing the hero into situations where they can't resort to their usual easy way out. What will they do? What impact will this have on their personality and on their character? It's a new angle to try on an old character, instantly refreshing it. And Rucka does it very well. \\n So why the low rating? I have two big problems with this. Elektra gets a lot of flak for being an assassin. She is a monster because she kills, or so Rucka says. But previous arcs have shown us that Elektra kills when she has to and tries to be as compassive as she can without risking her life while leading a successful career as an assassin for hire. She is not a murderer, she is a mercenary. And she only takes works when she believes in the outcome. Her life is fraught with morally dubious choices, but it isn't quite right to pin her down as a monster, because she is clearly not one. Presenting Elektra in this light is a complete misunderstanding of the character, and that bugs me. \\n And I can't quite keep out of my mind that she is getting this reformation arc because she is a woman. It seems that being an assassin is more reprehensible because she is female, and Marvel women can only be saints or whores. This feeling is reinforced because she is abducted by a white man who knows better, who wants to break her, enlighten her poor lost soul, and lead her to a new life of selflessness. A man whose fiancee had died to give him plausible motivation. A man who takes Elektra's agency because he is convinced he is morally superior and thus capable of saving Elketra. Deadpool would never get an arc like this one, for example. So let me say something: women can be as soulless as men, they can be evil, good, complex, selfish, selfless, whatever. Women have the whole range of personality traits because they are human. So can we please have a female assassin who is not shamed because she is a female assassin? \\n I'm looking forward to seeing if Rucka can get himself and Elektra out of this mess, but I'll have to start reading modern Ms. Marvel or Squirrel Girl at the same time in order to keep my sanity.\"),\n",

It is basically an anthology where each section is devoted to one particular Avenger. They all do connect and the reader does get to see that. This collection shows the affects on Captain America, Luke Cage, Spider-Woman, Sentry, and Iron Man. \\n I am the type of reader that when a book is being made into a movie I have to read the book first and then I have to read everything connected to it. That is why I am reading the whole Civil War event. That being said I am not the most knowledgeable Marvel fan and maybe that affected my rating as I can recognize Spider-Woman but I don't know her backstory. Also, I have no idea who Sentry was until I looked him up on the internet. \\n Even though I am not affluent with all these characters I did enjoy the stories. The Luke Cage story was amazing and worth buying this book just for that one. Like I said I did not know Sentry but I liked this story as it explores how these heroes feel about this war. This was explored in the other stories as well. I was a little disappointed with the Iron Man and Captain stories as I was expecting more from them. Also, I wasn't a fan of the artwork in a couple of the stories. \\n Overall, this was a nice collection that delves into the feelings of the war instead of the action side of it. This isn't an integral collection if you want to skip it but I do suggest reading the Luke Cage story.\"),\n",

The origin of Bloodshot as the latest in a line of created killers is great (especially given what we know of the future a thousand years down the road), and the core concept of him being a killing machine with a conscience is also intriguing. Overall, an interesting bit of introspection and background for the comic [7+/10]. \\n Hard CORPS (14-17). This arc reveals that Bloodshot year two is going to be totally different from year one. Combining the forces of Bloodshot and Hard CORPS is a cool idea, and makes even more sense within the context of the VH-E universe. The result is a super action-adventure extravaganza. There isn\\'t a lot of depth here (though we get some characterization and some nice interactions with Harada), but this is nonetheless a fun, light story [7/10]. \\n Get Some! (18-19). Unfortunately, the mission-based action-adventure structure for Bloodshot has already gotten stale. This is perfectly fine adventure, and it even has some good character moments for multiple characters, but ultimately it\\'s no deep [6/10]. \\n Bloodshot & HARD Corps (0). Nice to see that the Hard CORPS have a history too. This vignettes are a moving walk through the choices that made the modern-day team [7/10]. \\n Mission: Improbable (A&A 18-19, BS 20-21). It\\'s a lot of fun to see Bloodshot and the Hard CORPS in the context of Archer & Armstrong because they\\'re funny. Surprisingly, that funny carries across the whole crossover, in both the books. Though the funny comes straight out of Archer & Armstrong, it\\'s Bloodshot and the Hard CORPS that seem to have the major repercussions: we\\'re being set up for a major final battle between Bloodshot and PRS. Overall, a nice combo of the two books [7/10] \\n Blood Shot vs HARD Corps (22-23). A good finale to the Hard CORPS era of Bloodshot\\'s life. It was a bit sudden, but it nonetheless felt like it built on what came before. And, I\\'m going to miss the CORPS: I want to know what happens next to them and PRS! [7/10] \\n The Glitch & Other Tales (24-25). Sadly, this is an unimpressive end to Bloodshot. Of those scattered tales, only the eponymous \"Glitch\" is particularly interesting, but they\\'re so scattershot that they really don\\'t add much to the Bloodshot stop (and I\\'m also not sure how The Glitch fits into the chronology of Bloodshot 0). [5/10]. \\n Overall, this volume is weaker than the first Bloodshot volume. Though the inclusion of the HARD CORPS adds some interesting variety, the procedural stories that result are shallower ... and then the whole series peters out at the end. So call it 3.5 stars.

       "  \"It seems like every major new arc for the Swamp Things has to start with a question about who the Swamp Thing and Alec Holland are. Moore did it, so Morrison & Millar did it, and now Diggle does it to kick off V4. Even Snyder would later follow in the same footsteps. This time, we get the question: what if the Swamp Thing weren't Alec Holland?, but it has a different twist than Moore gave it. \\n The joy of Diggle's story is that it tries to be a good sequel to both of the previous volumes; we start off with an omnipotent Swamp Thing and an adult and powered Tefe (and if Swamp Thing didn't actually seem that omnipotent in Tefe's V3, I can deal with that, because I prefer to have both of the old topics resolved). \\n Unfortunately, I wasn't thrilled with the resolution of these plot threads. Clearly, the remit of this arc was to power down between Swamp Thing and Tefe, so that DC could go back to telling old stories of the sort that appeared before Millar's ever one-upping run. I can certainly agree that the Swamp Thing at the end of Millar's V2 was too high-powered for good story telling, but reverting him to a muck monster ... leaves me unthrilled. However, I think Tefe is dealt with even worse. Though I enjoyed seeing a conclusion to her story, her characterization wasn't great after the complexity of V3, and the ending was ... disappointing. (I in fact was very disappointed when I first read this years ago, since I'd loved the V3 Tefe run.) \\n There are nice elements here, like the use of Sargon, pretty much repeating his tricks from the early Millar run, and Constantine (horribly drawn) acting the manipulator. But it wasn't quite enough to make me love the story, primarily because of the big-red reset button that it represents.\"),\n",

I'm also very pleased with the way that Valiant seems to be telling their comics as complete stories, but then moving on to the next tale in the narrative. \\n Perfect Day (15-19). One of the joys of Dysart's Harbinger is that when things go totally off the rails, you never know if it's real or if it's imaginary, if it's mind control or minds slowly falling apart. And that's the case here. The story starts off a little small, but by the last few issues it's one of those teriffic multifaceted stories that Dysart does so well. Overall, it's another great story, especially for the focus on the characters of Pete, Harada, and even little Monica Jim. [8/10] \\n Resistance (20-21). I always found Ax to be one of the most irritating characters in the VH-1 universe, because he was sooo overused, and such a whining brat. It's great to see an alternate version of him created for the VH-E universe that's maintains some of the core ideas but is fun instead. Beyond that, this is another earth-shattering story. It's amazing how big of changes the VH-E universe is able to constantly support. And, if things are still a little confusing by the end of this two-issue arc, it's probably just because the story continues straight on into Death of a Renegade [8/10]. \\n Bleeding Monk (0). An OK backstory for the monk. It's interesting to see his history, but there's not much story here [6/10]. \\n Death of a Renegade (22-25). One of the joys of VH-E is that they're willing to bring their stories to big conclusions, and that's what happens here. Is it the best arc of Harbinger? No. But it's an epic story with real repercussions that nicely concludes most of the character stories. I've loved Dysart's Harbinger, but I love having an ending too [7+/10]. \\n Omegas (1-3). For the last six issues of Harbinger, Dysart taunted us with the story of what Harada did after the big conclusion of Harbinger. Now, we finally get the rest of that framing sequence. It was worth waiting for, but on the other hand, this is largely a bridge story, to get us from Harbinger to Imperium, so it's not a story that's at all conclusive [7/10].\"),\n",

While I found Rorshach\\'s voice a bit irritating in the beginning, I soon found myself back in the midst of the wonderful world that was created. The chapter\\'s blended together a little more seamlessly; less a celebration of the different forms of comic book storytelling and more the latest sequence that matched with the specific character(s) at the chapter\\'s focus. Oh, and the end made a lot more sense. \\n So now let\\'s open the movie versus book can of worms. For this is where I end up everytime I read a section of the book. \\n See, I read Watchmen in 2008 and then watched the movie in the theaters. It had been long enough between my reading that I had forgotten moments of the book and the way it was organized, but I came out of the movie theater going: \"The movie sucked because it was TOO CLOSE to the source material.\" \\n Well, I watched the movie again. I noticed the scenes that were ordered differently. The monologues that were in new places. Veidt\\'s skinnier look, the new ending, the lack of Tales of the Black Freighter, the added music (which I thought was originally quoted in the novel) ... and I still think that the movie is too close to the source material to work. Even though the graphic novel flowed better for me on this read (and the movie too), each chapter is meant as a stand-alone work in addition to its place in the grand story-arc. They each take on a different aspect of comic book storytelling that works in the panels but not in a movie frame. Also, certain scenes cut from the graphic novel to keep the runtime of the movie from exceeding 4 hours also kept the power of certain scenes left in the movie from matching that of the book. Again, too close to the material, and that showed the flaws. \\n ------ \\n Most of the reviews on this site will proclaim the majesty of Watchmen. From the wonderful use of the graphic novel/comic book medium (weaving many stories together through panels, speech, descriptions, extra \"books\") to the exciting story itself, this is a book that belongs on everyone\\'s read list. Yes, it will exercise your brain keeping track of the characters and the many different sub-plots, but it\\'s worth it! \\n Since other reviews will describe all the wonder, I will only mention my one qualm with the novel before ending this review. That is, the reveal at the end is revealed too quickly. It is the one place where too much happens too fast and the reader is too easily lost in the mix. I felt that the method to the madness should have had more explanation time. It is the only part in this book where I was overwhelmed with too much information and since we spent so long leading up to that part of the book ... let\\'s just say I felt a bit cheated. \\n I look forward to picking up this book again someday and revisiting the stories.

It's cool how Thomas picks up the Man-Thing origin just moments later but simultaneously pushes it straight into the Marvel universe, with Ka-Zar and AIM. However, once you get past that interesting premise, the story is more of a dud [5/10]. \\n Conway's End (Fear 10). Conway's return story certainly shows how little you can do with the concept of Man-Thing in a story that goes nowhere [3/10]. \\n Demonic Invasion! (Fear 11, 13-15). These stories are really all over the place, with new author Gerber seeming to revise his ideas from issue to issue. Nonetheless, he's creating a great world of magic and fantasy for the Man-Thing, with the introduction of Jennifer Kale, the swamp as a magical nexus, and of course an invasion of demons. (The demons themselves, one of which is named THOG, aren't that interesting, but their part as an element of a fantasy universe is.) [6+/10]. \\n No Choice of Colors (Fear 12). However, Gerber's best early story is actually this one about race and hatred. It touches upon deeper issues in keeping with the real-world focus of the previous Man-Thing, but does it in a more focused and thoughtful way [7/10]. \\n More Shorts (Fear 16-17,MTIO 1, Fear 18). The story of Indians and unions has a bit too many ideas to form a coherent storyline [5/10]. Meanwhile, the introduction of Wundarr is a wonderfully bizarre mix of Man-Thing, Superman, and science-fiction [7/10]. The team-up with Ben Grimm is pretty funny because it's based on their names, and it's interesting to see a variant Molecule Man, but otherwise is forgettable [5+/10]. Back in his own comic, Man-Thing haunts the edges of a tale of swamp survival, which is an amazingly intense character piece [7/10]. \\n The Enchanter's Apprentice (Fear 19, M-T 1). This is Gerber's Man-Thing at its best as we return to fantasy realms, demon invasions, and weird, wacky travels through other places. Howard the Duck debuts too, but his appearance is minor and relatively poorly characterized, and so not important. But, it's part of the strangeness that makes this arc great. And what a weird world of publishing, where a story could start in the 19th issue of an anthology title, and continue directly into the first issue of a new series [8/10]. \\n Nowhere To Go But Down (M-T 2). Another very '70s tale of humanity in the swamps. The story is complex and the characters are interesting [7/10]. \\n Fool-Killer (M-T 3-4). To make Man-Thing work, Gerber had to bring new weirdness and conflict to the swamp every week, and this is a good one: a crazed, incompetent killer. It's a rather delightful funny read (and no wonder other writers brought the Fool-Killer back at Marvel) [7+/10]. \\n All the Faces of Fear (MU5). A nice call-back to the title's origins as a black & white comic. Though the story is pretty minor, it's also a nice reminder of Man-Thing's origin story, with the return of a character who I'd like to see more of [6/10]. \\n Man-Clown (M-T 5-6). A nice combination of the supernatural and the human, melding together the two elements that Gerber has built his comic upon [7/10]. \\n Fountain of Youth (M-T 7-8). This finale does a good job of taking the largely unsuccessful construction-in-the-swamp plotline and dovetailing it into a search for the Fountain of Youth. Man-Thing is always at its best when it moves toward the mystical side of the world, and that's what we get here [7/10]. \\n Man-Thing is a tough series, because the protagonist isn't really a character. He's a plot device. Because of his bestial insanity, he can't change and we can't have character arcs about him. So everything has to move around him. Unfortunately, this also proves to be a problem for the series. Without an actual character to focus on, we get an ever-changing kaleidoscope of characters, all of whom are individually interesting, but which don't combine together to form a coherent story. This is made worse by the fact that the series constantly moves back and forth -- from fantasy to science-fiction to social commentary. It's all individually intriguing, but when read as a whole (even over the course of two months), it get monotonous because of the lack of an ongoing plot. \\n So, I loved many of the individual stories in this volume (at least after Gerber took over), but I was quite tired of it by the end.\"),\n",

Without any notice, the X-Men wake up in this institution in different bodies that are human. They need to get back home and they need to do this without their powers. \\n I was surprised how much I enjoyed this book considering it a superhero book with the characters having no abilities. This is your basic walking in someone else\\'s shoes and the author does a good job with this concept. She does a commendable job with the mutants adapting to a regular body and she adds humorous moments to this switch. There has to be funny moments with Wolverine trapped as a woman. I liked how the characters learn from this experience and has character growth which must be hard to convey with characters that are so established. The reason I subtracted a half star from my rating was the ending.

Dazzler is trying to reestablish herself after being used to harvest MGH, Mutant Growth Hormone, and having been impersonated by Mystique for the past several months.

It was well written and the way these topics were handled reminded me of old X-Men comics or the 90's cartoon (which is the way it should be!). What I love the most about volume 2 is how it shows how involved Storm is in the world, with mentions to her past with not just the X-Men, but also the Morlocks, her ties to Kenya (and to a minor extent Wakanda), and her experience as a thief.

       "  'Claim Jumping (Rucka). This story of territorial aggression is quite complex, and I\"m not sure that the territories were really the thing to focus on here. I also felt like the shocking ending was rather quickly swept under the rug by the next author. Still, there are some nice character moments here, and nice reminders of what NML is like [6+/10]. \\n The Mark of Cain (Puckett). Cassandra\\'s background story is interesting and very well told with lots of silent pages. Looking back from today, these issues are now a bit confusing because \"Batgirl\" had been on stage since the start of NML, but all is shortly explained .. [7/10]. \\n Young Justice (Dixon & Beatty). A sadly vapid story that adds nothing to the NML narrative. In fact, it sort of detracts from it, because Robin is talking about not going to Gotham ... at the exact time he\\'s summoned to Gotham. [2/10]. \\n Assembly (Rucka). A good turning point for the series and a good intro to the real Batgirl [7/10]. \\n Robin Travels (Dixon). A pity they couldn\\'t have arranged this story better in the collection, since it\\'s a bit weird to see Tim and Dick going to Gotham after we\\'ve already seen them in Gotham. The whole secret tunnel to Gotham is cool, but other than that it\\'s a pretty simplistic story [5+/10]. \\n Azrael (O\\'Neil). I continue to be happy with O\\'Neil\\'s Question-like writing, but it continues to feel out of tune with the rest of NML. The inclusion of Batgirl helps, but Scratch seems to help little place in the ecology of the No Man\\'s Land. Still, this is a nice climatic couple of issues [7/10]. \\n The Batman Chronicles: \\n \"Little Boy Lost\" (Beatty). A fair tale, mainly nice for its inclusion of another element of Batlore [5/10]. \"\"Turn On, Tune In, Freak Out\" (Wyn) and \"Identity Crisis\" (Renaud) are both nice for their man-on-the-street views of the NML craziness, and the first has a somewhat interesting storytelling technique [5+/10]. However, none of these stories have much depth, or (ultimately) are that memorable. \\n Robin in Blackgate (Dixon). DIxon just isn\\'t the strongest Bat-writer and this arc is hindered by very \\'90s villains and very \\'90s artwork, neither of which is a good thing. There\\'s a nice bit in the middle here where Dick is working with the cons, but otherwise this is lackluster as you\\'d expect [5+/10]. \\n Fruit of the Earth (Rucka). Great to see what\\'s going on with Ivy, who\\'s been hinted at throughout NML. The interactions between her, Bruce, and Clayface are a nice focus for this arc. However, I may actually like the interludes with the Blue Boys better. Overall, Rucka puts a very human face on all of NML\\'s troubles [7+/10]. \\n Catwoman (Ostrander). Better than some of the other new spinoff tiles, this one has superior writing and a tighter connection to the major plotlines in Gotham. Ostrander is a little too cutesy with his cat references, but otherwise it\\'s nice to see Selina acting as a burglar out for her own, and I\\'m curious as a cat to see what exactly happened in the last issue [6/10]. \\n Power Play (Hama). An attractive but shallow story about Mr. Freeze. [6/10] \\n In general, the core of NML tends to be good, but it\\'s hampered in this volume by increasing crossovers like Young Justice, Robin, and Catwoman. They\\'re all weaker than the core stories and they largely distract from. So, this is generally a more middling volume than its predecessor, hovering around 3.5 stars.'),\n",

And don\\'t expect many actual deaths in this Suicide Squad because magic nanites or something. \\n There\\'s some nice character work here between Deadshot and Harley.

It's been filled with mediocre writers and grimdark, angry, and arrogant superheroes -- all beholden to poorly conceived, overly intrusive editorial mandates and a house style that's often dull. \\n Jeff Lemire's Green Arrow shows what the New 52 could have been. He reinvents Green Arrow in a meaningful and interesting way and just drenches his stories with characterization. Hand-in-hand with that we've got a brave reinvention of the Arrow Mythos with the Outsiders. Finally, we've got strong art and interesting coloring that together make the book stand out on all fronts. Even better, this book stands as a cohesive whole. \\n Kill Machine (17-21). Lemire rather bravely starts off the volume by dismantling the Green Arrow comic of the first year and a half. It allows him to be dramatic, but this sort of thing can be overdone. Beyond that, there's great tension and great mystery. Ultimately, this is just a setup, with Ollie only learning about the Outsiders and setting out to search for the dragons as the story ends ... but it's a great setup [8/10]. \\n Vertigo (22-24, 23.1). The reinvention of Shado and Vertigo is well done, and again shows off what the New 52 could have been. Overall, this is a nicely presented Ollie, a nicely presented Team Arrow, and an exciting story [8/10]. \\n This seems to be when the Green Arrow comic really linked up with the Arrow TV show, which is a good thing given the strength of the TV show and the weakness of the comic before Lemire. Still, the comic continues to be its own thing, with surprises built into its history and a unique story about the Outsiders. \\n Zero Year (25). Most of the Zero Year crossovers were very forced, but this is instead a nice introduction for Diggle and a nicely retconned introduction of a Team Arrow -- all of which clearly links to the TV show [7/10]. \\n The Outsiders War (26-31). The Outsiders are an enjoyable new organization, and also a fun bit of connectivity to the old DC Universe (with Katana nailing the connection down, as a member of both). The return to the island is also great, for its ties to the TV show, but also for giving things its own (very twisted) twist. Finally, it's good to see the Lemire plotlines all come together. A little dense, but otherwise a good arc [7/10]. \\n Secret Origin. Nice enough, but short and not very enlightening [6/10]. \\n Broken (32-34). The finale to Lemire's run does a good job with the Dragon storyline that's been looming. I enjoy the continued characterization of Ollie's sidekicks and adore the return of Emiko, who feels like Arrow's own version of Damian Wayne (but unique enough to be interesting). The denouement is paced a little too quickly, with everything being neatened up in a few pages, but the main story of these issues doesn't seem impact by the sudden ending (in fact it might be paced better than some of the earlier storylines, which got a bit drawn out) [7+/10]. \\n Futures End. A nice coda, for the attention to Emiko and Naomi, and for the return of the Outsiders. Now we'll see if the next writer actually maintains any of these ideas. [7/10] \\n Overall, Lemire's run is right up there with the top Green Arrow runs. It never quite hits the heights of its first arc, but it's nonetheless good all the way through.\"),\n",

I'm a little annoyed at how easily our main character has been waylaid from finding Beth (and, truly, a little annoyed at how loyal he is to her) all, of course, for the greater good. \\n In short, this is a very fun and entertaining read, but still feels as if written in the 1950's if the last man on earth was a dweeb. Still, I'm intrigued enough to seek out the rest of this series. \\n Why? Because, despite the strange choices made on the part of the author, the characters engage a bit with the reader and have just enough depth to make me care about them. I mean, I want to see if Yorick makes it back to Beth. I want to see what occurs with 355 and Dr. Mann. I want to know where the Hero storyline ends up. These are all great characters illustrated with strong artwork and things have been kept lively without resorting to sexual innuendos or excessive violence. Truth be told, that is a huge step to take when writing a work like this. Even Richard Matheson's I Am Legend gets the hero laid soon after finding another live woman (granted, things are a little different there, but still). \\n So, if someone has Book 2 they're willing to lend me, I'll take good care of it.\"),\n",

To be fair to myself, I was eleven when it came out 32 years ago, and I only read it one time, and I\\'ve never owned a copy of the original. I read it at a friends house, so I suppose I shouldn\\'t have an expectation of clear memories, but still ... it was a surprise to read it again and see just how far removed my brain was from the reality. \\n First, I remembered the story being big. HUGE, in fact. But it spanned only two issues: X-Men #141-142. Second, I remembered Kitty Pryde, Colossus\\' Katya being more epically impressive; instead, she was heroic and cool, but in an understated, almost maternal way. Third, much of what I thought was part of the arc -- the rise of the Sentinels, the Trasks, Rachel Summers, Nimrod -- either happened before or after these two issues. Finally, I was sure Professor X was an important part of the tale, but Storm, Mystique, Kitty, Colossus, Wolverine and Franklin Richards were all much more important than the bald professor. \\n Yet reading it again wasn\\'t in anyway a disappointment. It is a cool tale, and it is easy to see why so many writers have gone back to those issues for inspiration, and some have even added to the \"Days of ...\" mythology, which is, I suspect, precisely what Brian Singer is hoping to do with his monster-sized Days of Future Past X-Man movie -- add to the mythology. I just hope he doesn\\'t fuck it up because this is a wonderful, compact and thrilling tale. \\n Kitty Pryde is a heroine with brains (she\\'s a genius, after all), and the dystopian 2013 (yep. it\\'s set in our current year) is creepy with very little effort. Muties in concentration camps, and Sentinels (drones) policing the movements -- and dampening the powers -- of the few mutants still wandering the Earth, and Wolverine leading the resistance from Canada, and two fights happening in two times to make the most horrible of futures impossible combine to make Days of Future Past one of the most unforgettable entries in Claremont/Byrne\\'s phenomenal collaboration (topped, for me, only by Dark Phoenix Saga). \\n Yep, we named our youngest Katya because of my love for Kitty Pryde, and this arc is a huge part of the reason why.'),\n",

Do you need to read the New52 Batman series? It is not necessary, but I highly recommend that you start there. The New52 Batman series is one of the few things that came out great from that era. \\n Unlike Detective Comics, Batman comics is obviously a Bat-centric series, and here we see what the Caped Crusader can do.

Well, I\\'m happy to report I was pleasantly surprised with this one. Injustice has action, tragedy, romance--everything you could ever want from a totally addicting comic series. \\n Written by Tom Taylor, Injustice is set before the events of the game, so it acts as a prequel to that dystopian future. After being tricked into killing the one thing he loved most, Lois Lane, Superman is now out for blood! Vowing to never allow such a thing to happen again, Superman decides to take totalitarian rule of the city and impose a fierce concept of justice. The one thing that stands in his way: Batman! Each side forms unlikely allies with heroes and villains alike as they fight for a future neither is sure of. \\n I really liked the narrative in this volume. To me, Superman is usually such a \"perfect\" character that I have trouble relating to him. In this narrative, though, he has faults, he goes through a mental breakdown, and he makes awful decisions, so I like him a lot more. Weirdly enough, he makes a pretty amazing villain. \\n The art, done by illustrator Jheremy Raapack, is awesome. There are a couple of issues with anatomy here and there--for example they took the cartoon element a little too far in the facial expressions--but overall I think it\\'s quite marvellous. The colours are bright, despite the overall dark tone of the book, kept vibrant through use of colour opposition and cell shading. \\n I really enjoyed my first foray into this series, and will probably continue on with it.

Thus in a few words, I try to summarize what I felt about the ending, and please pardon my language: \\n \"And they fuck*ng lived fuckin*ly happily ever after. So f*ck you and I love you, Preacher has ended.\" \\n Alamo, the last volume is way more grounded and personal than the other volumes of Preacher. In fact, it is those personal grudges and motivations that drove all the main characters in doing what they ought to do. All the religious political BS and the \"confronting god\" thing for me just took a backseat in this last arc. \\n If there is one negative thing I can add in this review, it was really Jesse Custer\\'s plan. It may be brilliant and feasible from the preacher\\'s point of view, but it is anti-climatic and a eenie-bit of a letdown from a reader\\'s point of view. I mean, that has got to be the Jesse\\'s main mission in the whole series, a sort of genesis versus god fight ala-Mortal Kombat right? \\n As for the main series, Genesis really, really felt to be hugely underused and underdeveloped. The demon-angel lovechild didn\\'t not really lived up to its full potential and the power of the Word being not as formidable and dangerous as it should have been.

Its fate was inevitable, but yet too convenient. \\n Arseface\\'s charm was felt until the conclusion of his story, but he could have been part of a larger scheme. But this is just nitpicking though. He is anyway the Hodor of the story. Herr Starr\\'s fate was also inevitable, but Ennis made sure that it was helluva fun to see him being laughed at which is a sort of guilty pleasure feeling. The Saint of Killer\\'s on the other hand got his dream of revenge fulfilled, though I doubt if the satisfaction will last forever. This kinda reminds me of Kratos. \\n As for Jesse, Cass and Tulip, our three main characters, I will let you read what ultimately happened to them. \\n For me, Preacher may not top the feeling I got from Scalped for a big chunk of the series but Ennis certainly nailed a better ending than Jason Aaron.

Instead, The Secret Defenders is essentially a Dr. Strange team-up comic, where he brings together a new team of heroes for each (short) arc. The deficit of this is of course that you lose all the character arcs, which were a big part of the original Defenders and much of what made it intriguing. \\n The first eight issues of The Secret Defenders are by Roy Thomas, and they're thoroughly mediocre. Three teams of Secret Defenders fight against three very forgettable villains, without much plot beyond the fighting. The stories are thus just as forgettable. \\n The last three issues in this volume are by Ron Marz. He's saddled by what may be the ugliest artist I've ever seen working for Marvel, and his stories aren't any better. If anything, they're even more troublesome, because they're so suddenly focused on the cosmic comics of the time such as Silver Surfer and some Star*Brand crossover, and thus don't make a lot of sense without that context.

But Zero Year has a more nice ring to it, a sort of nod to Frank Miller\\'s more grounded and brutal Year One (and still the definitive Batman origin story). \\n Snyder, in his exceptionally well-written Batman arcs, always has a thesis in mind as the foundation and works the way up in the most amazing ways to deliver a montage of memorable Bat stories. In Zero Year, aside from a modern retelling of Batman\\'s origin, Snyder establishes two tenets in the Batman mythos: number one, Bruce cannot be just a vigilante Bruce to take up crime on his hands, he has to be Batman and two, Gotham City needs Batman. Embedded in these two rudimentary philosophies are side stories that are seamlessly put together by the genius mind of Scott Snyder. We have Red Hood and The Jokers origin, the giant coin in the Batcave, the Batcave itself, the Bat-signal, the Batman-Gordon friendship and most notably an outstandingly good Riddler story. \\n This is what happens when Edward Nygma rises up to the throne unchecked, undisputed and unrivaled. He has the capability to turn the City into a dark place. Although Snyder goes a bit in excess with all those drones and killer bots (but this is comics, I guess? Kinda like how can Bruce afford those large computers with large screens in the Batcave and all sorts of Batman stuff, or how can the Joker implement that elaborate plan in Death of the Family), this Zero Year is what separates The Riddler from the Clown Prince of Crime - The Joker is all about the laughs and his twisted love for Batman while the The Riddler takes so much pride in his intellectual prowess to a fault and openly challenges everybody to beat him and his riddles. \\n As a short aside, can I just say that Greg Capullo kills it big time in Zero Year? I mean o my god. This guy draws exceptionally fantastic! Capullo (and Danny Miki of course) perfectly, I mean perfectly illustrates the story. The colors are vibrant with a significant touch of lush green, the postapocalyptic-ish rendering of Gotham City truly tells how it has been abandoned and given-up. \\n Gotham City itself in Dark City is one large riddle. Freeing it from the hands of Nygma has become a personal mission for Batman. Alone, he cannot do it. The book shows to us that The Riddler is way intellectually superior to Bruce. So how did he beat the green skinny man? Snyder then displays us what Batman can do: 1. Bataman is a detective, devising a feasible plan to defeat the Riddler, solely figuring out where his lair is and even goes one-on-one brain-wise with The Riddler. 2. Batman has the technology and gadgets to do his, though in Zero Year they are still crude, they do the job. 3. He has allies. Bruce has Gordon as his wingman, Lucius Fox as his tech expert and Alfred as the one who will tend to his needs. And finally, 4. Batman has the physical advantage, the muscle to punch Edward Nygma (hugely gratifying) and stomp him to oblivion. \\n So whenever Batman says that Gotham \"is my city\". This is the definitive justification why he has rightfully earned it. \\n Saying that Zero Year is a Batman origin story is an oversimplification of what it really is. It is a study of the rudimentary ideals that make up the Batman: a detective, a vigilante, a hero. It is a baptism by blood of the City itself. Zero Year is a modern tale, deep and at the same time entertaining, a literature that everybody should read.'),\n",

When Comixology.com recently had the entire World War Hulk series on sale - I jumped at the chance! \\n In brief, Tony Stark (Ironman) and others (Fantastic Four, Black Bolt et al.) trick the Hulk And banish him to Sakaar - a distant planet. In a separate story arc, the Hulk becomes a more fearsome warrior, is made a king, marries and is about to become a father. Events on this planet (not told in this graphic novel) cause him to lose everything he had fought for, cherished and loved. He then finds a spacecraft, which he pilots back to Earth...Filled with rage, he seeks revenge on that banished him!! \\n Positively, I was most impressed with the artwork. The artists (Romita and Janson) aptly capture the battle scenes with much action and energy. You can feel the power and anger of the Hulk as he lays into his enemies! \\n On the other hand, having recently read The Dark Knight Rises and Court of Owls - I must say I was a little disappointed with the writing and storytelling. Wave after wave of superheroes take on the Hulk with various results - it did become a little tedious after a while. While the artwork was a visual treat, the writing did feel clunky and awkward at times. There was either too little or too much exposition from secondary characters. \\n While this was my first Hulk graphic novel and exposure to writer, Greg Pak, I will not be put off by this particular story arc - it did leave me wanting to learn more. I would recommend this for Hulk fans and those who have had more exposure to the larger Hulk/Marvel universe.\"),\n",

Add in the many one off volumes and ancillary series that Bill Willingham has produced, now over more than a decade, and one cannot help but feel a certain awe at this author\\'s vast creative reservoirs. Like many readers who delight in each new volume of this epic series, I cannot but now see each as somewhat bittersweet knowing that it will cease publication sometime in 2015. These feelings are only deepened by the real power of this volume and the last (I found the whole \"Mr. Dark Interlude\" interesting, but wanting in comparison to the struggle with the Adversary that dominated so many volumes of the series). In case you imagined that Willingham might be running out of ideas, \"Snow White\" quickly disproves the possibility. And as sad as I am about the series looming conclusion, I appreciate the creative team\\'s obvious intention to close many of the dangling story lines in the coming years. \\n The rich cast lies at the heart of Fable\\'s success and in one portion of this volume we learn the fate of Bufkin, the acerbic flying monkey (who can no longer fly) as well as Lilly, his (girl?) friend. As with much of this volume, revealing much violates my commitment to avoiding spoilers, but suffice to say that this story simply delights. Here we have all that makes Fables so extraordinary - Willingham\\'s rich character studies combined with his unique interpretation of the vast world of story, combined with some excellent art that balances the fantastical and the mundane. Oz fans, and no doubt many of them enjoy Fables, will find great satisfaction in learning the fate of the Gnome King, and I for one found the story\\'s conclusion quite poignant. \\n The other main story in the volume follows Snow White and Bigsby after the disappearance of two of their cubs. This one has even more spoiler risk, so suffice to say when a new (old) prince shows up to make a claim on Snow White, her husband The Wolf will take it about as well as you might expect. Again, here we see all of Willingham\\'s gifts on full display: great characterization, pitch perfect pacing, rich dialogue, and an ending that will surely have you checking the date for the release of volume 20. \\n As a final note, I received a free advance ecopy of this from Netgalleys in exchange for an honest review. However, unable to bare the empty space on my book shelf, I am ordering a copy as well. Yes, it is that good...'),\n",

But more generally, this story sets an interesting foundation for NML of warring tribes in a post-apocalyptic city and uses that basis to create a very different sort of Batman story based on ethics and morals. The introduction of a new Batgirl and the strong focus on The Gotham PD both add to the enjoyment of this story [7/10]. \\n Fear of Faith by Grayson. I find it fascinating that this arc focuses on a new political group (the church), a new heroine (Huntress), and a new villain (Scarecrow). It shows the potential power of treating Gotham as a setting for adventure that can be inhabited by many peoples and groups. This tale of a powerless Scarecrow is fascinating, but also way too slow [6/10]. \\n Bread & Circuses by Edgington. At first this story feels repetitive, as we've seen the elements before, but it finally puts the Penguin front-and-center, and the battle of wits between him and Batman actually proves very interesting, as it's never clear who's on top [7/10]. \\n Mosaic by Rucka. Rucka was one of the main reasons I picked up these volumes. His first story is interesting and unusual, but also badly fractured ... which pretty much goes to the name. Despite horrible art, some great characterization really comes through, continuing to add depth to the new setting [7/10]. \\n The Batman Chronicles: \\n Two Down by Rucka A great early Montaya story that shines for his relationship with Two Face [8/10]. The Comforts of Home by Beatty. An amusing story because it shows the dangers left in Gotham [7/10]. Harold by O'Neil. A shallow vignette [5/10]. \\n Other Shorts: \\n Balance by Rucka. A nice, if shallow story about Alfred [7/10]. Home Sweet Home by Klink. A great look at a citizen in NML, with beautiful art by Guy Davis [7+/10]. The Visitor by Puckett. A good answer to the question of why other heroes aren't saving Gotham [7/10]. Shades of Gray by Gale. This final short does a terrific job of reminding us of some of the main factions of Gotham, while also offering a few great stories; the one about Bruce's father is particularly strong [8/10]. \\n Azrael by O'Neil. The Azrael issues are a bit troublesome because they're so out of tune with the rest of the volume. O'Neil doesn't participate in the round-robin writing and generally doesn't seem to care about the plot threads of the rest of the collection. I also found the first couple of issues actively bad, though it might have been me getting used to O'Neil's style again. By the last few issues, I felt like I was reading about a variant of The Question, which was interesting, but not necessarily good for the collection. \\n Overall, I was surprised how good the whole volume was.

It starts out by moving the Miracle family to the galactic stage, something that was promised since the earliest days of the comic, and thus acts as a nice bookend. Unfortunately, the last two issues of Moore\\'s Miracleman story are the most mixed. The final battle with Bates (#15) is a bit repetitive, but also the most moving issue of this volume. The Olympus issue (#16) spends way too much time on telling (not showing), but in bringing us up to date with that Golden Age frame, it was a vastly innovative ending for a super-series and the ultimate foundation that Gaiman built his sequel on. \\n As a whole this is the weakest of Moore\\'s three Miraclemen volumes, as the new stuff is less powerful, and the powerful stuff is less new.

It features short stories written and illustrated by local writers and artists, who came together to produce this work with an animal theme. However, with creatures like unicorns and dinosaurs, the term \"fauna\" might be a bit of a stretch. \\n Since this collaborative work is made up of 25 different short stories, discussing narrative and plot is a little difficult.

On the more serious side are stories such as A Grandmother\\'s Tale by Ian Thomas and Jeri Weaver, a beautifully illustrated dream sequence teaching the importance of ocean conservation.

However, there were a few exceptions, such as Amanda and the Mantis by Cameron Morris and Nina Matsumoto. The story is based on a widely believed praying mantis theory that\\'s less than factual, which is a little disappointing to see in this anthology. \\n Art-wise, this graphic novel is all over the place as far as styles and quality go.

But what is his motivation? Volume 1 of The God Butcher ends one issue shy of these revelations, yet there were plenty of theories: Gods suck; they cause too much pain and suffering; Gorr wonders where the Gods of \"poetry and flowers\" are and why they are so out numbered by Gods of war and strife, so we wondered if it is us or the gods that make for this split, and if it is us can the gods be blamed? and is Gorr blaming the gods unfairly? and would Gorr care?; or what if Gorr is a God himself, the God of Deicide, called into existence by all of those who feel wronged by Gods, who utter curses under our breath or scream them at the heavens, what if Gorr\\'s motivation is his very existence, born of us?; we had no answers but plenty of questions and theories. \\n Then we pondered Jason Aaron\\'s three Thors: young Thor, pre-Mjolnir, very much like the bellicose Thor of Norse Mythology; our Thor or middle Thor, worthy of Mjolnir (in the comic book way), driven to save the Gods from Gorr, answering prayers on planets far away; future Thor, a sort of Thor/Odin, an All-Father alone in Asgard, last god standing. The trio caused some confusion, but seeing the three juxtaposed, it was decided, gave us a unique perspective on character development -- the fully realized arc in three easy steps, achieved at the earliest possible convenience, but I think it is something more, a meditation on stereotypes of masculinity, which leads me to the other thing we discussed .... \\n ... The lack of women. There was one female who spoke in the The God Butcher, a Viking elder, a sort of witch woman, and the rest of the women were in the background. We were told that young, unworthy Thor was sure to have bedded them. This lack of women as actors in the story moved into our discussion and shifted from indifferent to disappointed to frustrated to angry. Where were the women? Why the sexism? But the more I thought about it and think about it the less this glaring omission of women glares. There is a thrilling asexuality about Gorr (the only character of import outside of the three Thors), and the story is almost solely about Thor himself, meaning that few other characters have any place in the book, male or female (yet the other Gods Thor speaks to are male, so there is that). \\n And then our discussion wound down and moved on to other things. A comic book did that. A graphic novel. An excellently scripted, beautifully painted, thrillingly conceived run of Thor comics that will be a landmark arc in the Marvel history of Thor.

He is doing what authors do, and unless he is going to be writing in some archaic Norse, no matter how he writes will include a measure of anachronism. \\n There are times, however, when Sven -- the Northman returning from a life in Constantinople to reclaim his land and titles -- and his self-awareness and contemporary anxieties pull me out of immersion in the story. Much like the use of vulgarity, Wood is doing nothing with his period characters that other authors who write about the past have done. It is the nature of historical writing. It succeeds better, however, when readers don\\'t notice the contemporaneousness. When I do, when it pulls my consciousness out of the narrative, when it becomes a distraction, as it does in this first arc of the Northlanders, it diminishes my enjoyment of the piece. But I completely understand that anyone reading this completely subject complaint of mine could dismiss it as readily as I dismissed the complaints about vulgarity. If you do not share my feelings about contemporaneousness, my complaint will mean little to you. \\n Yet there is still much to dig in these pages. I was genuinely surprised when the \"revenge\" narrative took a turn to the self-defensive; I thought there was some genuine emotional truth to be found in Sven\\'s relations with the women in his life; the setting of the Orkney islands and the accompanying artwork by Davide Gianfelice was properly isolating and desolate, and I loved the symbolic flourish -- which Wood is a fan of producing -- of the raven following Sven through his return and retreat. \\n I hope that it gets better in the arcs to come because this is a promising beginning. Moreover, I hope that Wood engages in some Demo style writing, wherein the arcs move from one Northman to another rather than sticking with Sven forever. I feel like I\\'ve seen all I need to be about Sven. I want someone else. I want a new tale. And if if goes that way I can see it rising to meet the expectations I -- perhaps unfairly -- had when I started reading Sven the Returned.'),\n",

       "  'Some comic readers grouse about Geoff Johns, but who can deny his talent? The man is a creative whirlwind! After a decade expanding and deepening the Green Lantern Universe, he has now shifted his attention to Aquaman. Why bring this up with regards to Justice League Volume 3? While a Justice League book, \"Throne of Atlantis\" continues Johns - who also pens the character\\'s solo title -- effort to make Aquaman cool again. The first two volumes of Justice League have received somewhat mixed reviews. Despite excellent character interactions, some complained that the actual story lacked the dynamism Johns\\' demonstrated in other work. This volume does away with any such doubt: here Johns delivers an excellent story, Shakespearean in its themes and drama. \\n As always, I will maintain my strict commitment to avoid major spoilers. The first part of this volume, offers a wonderful Hors d\\'oeuvre. As much as any writer at DC, Johns has reveled in the creative opportunity of the \"New 52\" relaunch. Here he offers a new take on a classic Wonder Woman villain, as well as using it as an opportunity to deepen the complex Wonder Woman/Superman relationship and explore some of the complexity of Wonder Woman\\'s character. I suspect that the seeds he plants in this story will bloom later with broad implications for the larger DC universe. \\n As for the main course, Johns is serving sea food. A mysterious villain has engineered a war between Atlantis and the surface world. Despite the nefarious forces that start the war, Aquaman is torn - how can a king fight his own kingdom? This rich drama is further spiced by the excellent interactions between Aquaman and his team mates. Team books more than others depend on the friction in the character dynamic and there is nothing like a crisis to heighten that drama! The Aquaman/Batman interaction is particularly interesting, a previously under-explored relationship which here just shines! Of course, the focus remains squarely on Aquaman. What will he do? Which side will he take? What does one do when everyone can make an appeal to justice? Johns\\' writing, his depth of characterization and sizzling dialogue, make for a page turning read. \\n As for dessert - and I apologize for pushing this metaphor about twice as far as good taste allows - Ivan Reis\\'s work just leaps off the page. He\\'s demonstrated his talent elsewhere, not least on the two previous volumes, but epic battles and destruction just plays to his strengths. His work here is big and bold, full of emotional heft and violence. He and Johns make an excellent match. \\n Justice League volume 3, \"Throne of Atlantis\" is just about everything I look for in a superhero comic and some of the best work to come out of the New 52. Any doubts harbored about this series should not be put to rest for good. Here is a comic you\\'ll want to take down from the shelf again and again. Don\\'t miss the action! \\n DC provided a digital version of this comic through Netgalleys in exchange for an honest review.'),\n",

It was recommended and loaned to me by an acquaintance of his based on my adoration of Alison Bechdel\\'s work. My friend did qualify the loan with the caveat that this does pale in comparison to Fun Home but said I would enjoy it. In truth I did enjoy it but I also could not shake the association to one of the greatest works in modern letters and I felt terribly disappointed. I hope the prose somewhat cliche and the story quite melodramatic. Not that the things that occur in the story are not enormously serious and dramatic but I feel the way they are handled did not do the weight of these things justice. This was not due to a lightheartedness either. The jacket blurbs promised crying and laughter being provoked by every other page but I hardly remember chuckling at all. Even the portion about Jonathon A. reading an essay about soiling his pants fell kind of flat when it should have been at least very amusing. I actually think it was the lack of life I felt in the illustrations. Yes, they are technically proficient but they seemed awfully stale to me. \\n I just wanted so much more exploration of all the multitudinous vices more or less merely mentioned in the book. This could have been really moving and transformative but it never broke past solipsistic journaling. Which is fine but not great by any means. \\n I also agree with other reviewers that the renderings of everyone (especially the women, to the mammoth shame of the illustrator) are bizarrely \"idealized\" and it all detracts from the story because, even if some of it is a fiction, it loses a sense of humanity necessary to care.'),\n",

       "  'I was pretty pleasantly surprised. I picked it up at a 2.99 used graphic novel sale where I work and the whole \"convict turned Ivy League MFA\" intrigued me. I saw it more structured like a screenplay. People are hung up by the medium he used and the method he used to portray it, but to the extent he utilized illustration was reminiscent of older Bugs Bunny cartoons where the narrator said something and it was illustrated below. I believe how he used the medium was very telling of the time period he grew up in. It\\'s not your traditional graphic novel and it\\'s not your traditional memoir. I\\'ve worked with ex-cons and can appreciate the story he was telling and how he chose to tell it. If you\\'re going into this expecting the graphic to tell the story versus words, you\\'re not receiving the story correctly. He uses illustrations to emphasize his words and almost expresses a sense of irony when he does so. No, the illustrations aren\\'t the best but it\\'s what gives the story it\\'s real characteristic. It\\'s something I\\'d expect from an MFA, actually. \\n The thing about ex-cons is that they\\'re never fully rehabilitated. His parallels of university to prison are fairly spot-on and it\\'s quite insightful as to how we as a modern society perceive felons. It speaks volumes and is very important, I believe, in the whole rehabilitation farce that the prison system attempts to portray. I believe this is a very important novel in expressing how felons aren\\'t just ne\\'er-do-wells with zero intelligence. They\\'re quite intelligent and if they focused their intelligence for good, then we\\'d go far. But it highlights the hypocrisy of the bureaucracy involved in prison AND in university as well as the limitations of liberals involved in rehabilitating prisoners despite their intellectual potential. \\n He did a bold thing releasing this. The back and forth of timeline is very modern in film, which makes me believe he could\\'ve done more with this for film versus the medium he chose. Great job, though. It\\'s very honest.'),\n",

       "  'Covers chapters 10-12.5 \\n see full review @ Katie\\'s Corner \\n Pictures are shown on the blog :) \\n I do not really remember how I came across this manga, but I do remember that I stayed up all night to finish all the available chapters, because it was really interesting. \\n You might say that the idea behind the story is not so new, however, how everything is down played and described is something worth applauding to. The characters, the place, the life situations that the manga covers are well described and give off strong individuality. Our main characters - Suzuki Tarou and Suzuki Hanako are absolutely amazing. No, they are not siblings; they just have same surname. Those two are plain, four-eyed students, normal average Japanese people (stated in the manga, not my stereotype). \\n They applied to the super elite school, only because the principles of the school influenced them. But, when they get to see that those principles are just words and that in their school bulling is a normal thing, they change themselves according to their role models (yakudza boss-from the movies) and now they will make the Aidan School into the school of their dream. Will they succeed? Start reading now and know it for yourself! \\n I\\'ll be definitely making a second review as soon as the all chapters are available on the site I read on. So today I will be focusing on the \"villain\" of this story - Naoji Dougan. Why did I choose him? If you\\'ve read the manga then you know whom he is. For those who don\\'t: he is the sun of the director couple of the Aidan Academy. He is also acting as the student council president and the model student for the whole academy. Everything would have been amazing, if not his awful attitude towards the school. If in the very beginning and up till chapter 11 he\\'s the awful villain, after that the more you seem to get to know about him the more you understand him and you might even find yourself supporting him. What\\'s his problem? Well, the problem mainly is in his parents, especially in his mother. I don\\'t get her; she just tries to strip him off his personality just to get an heir to the school, how sick is that. When she handcuffed him, and made him color pictures and do origami I couldn\\'t contain my astonishment and I became so team Naoji. Though I do understand his motives, but I just can\\'t support him, mostly due to violence and bulling the core of the changes he tries to make. He makes an amazing character; he\\'s one of those villain characters that are essential to the story. Without such character the story wouldn\\'t have been as great. I really wish to see how his relationship with Ibuki will be going, I so wish those two to end up together for good, and she will make him find his happiness. \\n I hope you\\'ll find some time to read this amazing manga. It is full of nice jokes and life situations; the story is fast paces and very interesting. Next time I review it I\\'ll be focusing on relationships between the characters and of course on our favourite Suzuki Duo. \\n You\\'ll love them really a lot. They are amazing characters, but we\\'ll talk about them next time. Enjoy it to its fullest and don\\'t forget to share your thoughts below.'),\n",

       "  'This was an interesting book. It takes the Shakespearean characters and mash them into one world with Will Shakespeare as a God with a magic quill. Richard wants Shakespeare dead so he can take the power of the quill himself. He takes on Hamlet as a chosen one type \"shadow king\" that is supposed to be able to find the lost God. Juliet leads an rebellion against King Richard, beside her is Othello and Falstaff and others. MacBeth holds armies and kingdoms but quickly comes to a poor fate. There are old crones and witches and ghosts and whatnot. There was a brief appearance by Robin Goodfellow and little easter eggs abound, like a tavern called A Midsummers Nights Dram. The Fable series does this well with the fairy tale characters. I\\'m not sure if the creators are the same or not, I haven\\'t read Fable. \\n The story is decent, nothing out of the ordinary. I\\'m not terribly familiar with the works of Shakespeare but this kind of follows a similar style to some of his works. The writing is definitely reminiscent of Shakespearean language. It isn\\'t written in iambic pentameter, at least not consistently, but the style of prose is similar. There is plenty of thee and thou but it sometimes seems not consistent, like some spots should have had it but didn\\'t. Either way, it\\'s an interesting read and I look forward to continuing the series. \\n The artwork is also nice. It\\'s colorful, which sometimes reminds me of a Saturday morning cartoon, especially for such a dark work. There are lots of bright red splashes of blood, and also dark woods, and pastoral settings, and orange and red witches fires. It has strong dark lines and deep contrasting shadows. It works well for the subject matter. The bonus artwork in the back of the book was also cool.'),\n",

Even though the title suggests this would concern the Sinister Six, they are the minor storyline. This story concentrates on Mysterio and his plans to revenge on those who he believed that have wronged him in the past. Our favorite wall crawler plans to stop him. \\n This was an enjoyable read and this author has penned several books in this universe and I have not read a bad one from him. This has all the earmarks on would expect from this type of book. It has other beloved characters from this world, name dropping that connects it to other Marvel characters, the funny quips which is a trademark of our main character, and plenty of action. The only reason I did not give this a higher rating is a personal one. I have never been a fan of Mysterio but with that being said, this book does entertain. \\n This book does what it is suppose to do. It is not great literature but I satisfies the comic book fan inside me. From the references to pop culture to fantastic images (Spidey battling mechanical sharks), this book satisfies and this trilogy only gets better as I have already read the other two books and they were terrific.'),\n",

It sucks all of the mystery out of the character of the Phantom Stranger, offers up a horribly contrived and stunted origin for the Spectre, and makes God into a real jerk. Besides that, the writing is very stilted. And, things only get a little better from there. The scripting is awful until issue #3, when DeMattheis takes over, and the plotting never develops into anything coherent. Instead Didio continually throws as much as he can into the pot, as if he were making stew out of leftovers. \\n However, it's the reinvention of DC's mystical heroes that's the most painful: Didio decides to recreate these heroes in ways that directly contradict what makes them interesting. So we have a Phantom Stranger who's no longer mysterious and a Terrance Thirteen who embraces ghosts.

I even like Conway\\'s new villains that have been less successful like Grizzly and Cyclone. Finally, we get real momentous events, as Conway isn\\'t afraid to change up the status quo. Clearly the death of a Spider-Man was one of these. This would all have repercussions for decades afterward, but besides being innovative and memorable, this is just a plain good story -- and a great one for its time [8/10]. \\n PPtSS (25-31): Carrion. Unfortunately, Bill Mantlo\\'s writing isn\\'t up to the same standards. He spends almost all of his time on heroics and fighting. The supporting cast does appear, but only in a few pages per issue. The three issues that start off this set (25-28) are largely about the Maggia, the Masked Marauder, and the Tri-Man. Unfortunately they border on bad. Beyond Spider-Man\\'s hysterics about losing his sight, we also have a Tri-Man android that can turn into a ... bombdroid. No, seriously. It\\'s nice to get the couple of pages that mark Carrion\\'s first appearances, but these issues are barely worth reading other than that [4/10]. The Carrion story proper (28-31) is a little better. After all, it introduces Carrion ... and has a little better focus on Peter\\'s life. On the downside, we get a battle with Spider-Amoeba (no, seriously) and other bits of stupidity and way too much fighting [5/10]. \\n Spectacular Annual (6): The Gwen Clone. Almost 15 years later, Conway\\'s writing has if anything improved. His captions are great, as is his attention to the Gwen/MJ/Peter triangle. Unfortunately this annual is burdened with annoying \"Young Gods\" and a horrendously bad retcon about the original clone stories [6/10]. \\n Spectacular (149): The Carrion Secret. This story continues the retcons from the Spectacular Annual to no real purpose other than \"cleaning up\" a plot thread that didn\\'t need cleaning up. Again, Conway does a great job with Peter\\'s life ... but I could do without the new origin for Carrion (though it works better than the Gwen retcon). [5/10]. \\n Spectacular (162-163): Carrion & Hobgoblin. The final team-up between Carrion & Hobgoblin is kind of fun and decently written, but doesn\\'t have much depth [6/10]. \\n Overall, Conway\\'s stories from the \\'70s are terrific. Unfortunately, the rest of the collection is a let-down -- both in the quality of the writing and in the damage done to the original Clone saga with dumb retcons. Fortunately, as I understand it, the retcons about Gwen and thus the Peter clones have since been undone ... \\n Though it was kind of nice to get the original Clone and Carrion stories all in one place, this volume suggests to me that what Marvel should instead be publishing is a set of Gerry Conway collections.'),\n",

The minor plot is the reader gets a flashback of Anakin contemplating about leaving the Jedi order and Senator Palpatine starts taking an interest in Anakin. \\n This was a decent collection. The highlight was the artwork. The artwork was gorgeous especially the full page panels. I liked how the artwork was light in tone and it showed so much detail and beauty.

The main plot never really interested me. This plot involved steampunk and I am not a fan of this genre. Maybe I was turned off right away because of this but I was never interested in the conflict and I thought the ending was a little too convenient.

Usually it\\'s only hints, and the male characters don\\'t seem to want to offend the post-feminist sensibilities of the women, so instead the women tote guns and put their wombs at risk of becoming a zombie-buffet. But everyone gets along-ish, and there are usually plenty of women and men, so it doesn\\'t seem like fertility is the most important concern. \\n Or you get the big, bad group of fascist men trying to turn some poor girl into a \"breeder\" for the new human race, but she tends to rise up, spank their patriarchal asses, escape with her girl power intact, and hook up with some nice guy with whom she\\'s fought for survival. \\n And in the bleakest of apocalypses there\\'s no hope anyway, so who gives a shit about procreation? Everyone\\'s dead or dying, cannibalism is running rampant, society has failed, and humans are doomed to extinction. The best the survivors can do is keep hiking down some road to whatever is further down the road with the world as nothing but the road. \\n But I\\'ve totally fucking had it now that I\\'ve read Y: The Last Man.

His sperm, and Ampersand\\'s, would be the most important substances known to womankind (not because he is a man but because of sheer practicality). He would be protected whether he liked it or not. He would be imprisoned. His sperm would be used to impregnate. It would be used to find an immunity for future boys. It would be used for the survival of homo sapiens. Period. \\n I heard this book was really great -- a must read graphic novel. At best it is okay ... if you look past the idiocy of Yorick\\'s wanderings, his insufferable smarminess, that stupid fucking monkey, and the poorest characterizations of women you\\'re ever likely to see.

Noelle Stevenson clearly knows how to entertain an awfully large range of readers, not just age-wise, but readers from those who just wanted the fun out of the material and those who will do anything to spark an in-depth discourse to just about anybody about what they have read. It is Nimona's simplicity and charm that has captured the hearts of so many. \\n Nimona is set in a medieval fantasy world where magic, knights and dragons are real. Yet it has huge chunks of sci-fi and modern elements in it. The eponymous protagonist is a shapeshifter girl who teams up with an older ex-knight-turned-villain. They go on doing their evil plans against a shady institution. \\n It is so easy to get hooked by the book. The character Nimona is charming and interesting AF that you'd almost instantly invest in knowing more about her. What's her story? What happened to her? How powerful is she? \\n As the story progresses, the whole story becomes deeper and darker. There's the typical dark science secrets that are uncovered, as well as expositions on some events on the past. Nimona though, does not go full dark and brooding. When all things seem to go down that road, the story finds its way to light up again. \\n The story can be taken as is, although several non-fantasy elements are also there. You'd have this government figure which thinks it is doing the right thing, the moral burden of killing and even sexuality of the characters. Again, going into these things are entirely optional since the story and art itself are enough reasons for you to read it. \\n Nimona is certainly one of those books you can recommend to just anybody.\"),\n",

This one calls back to some of Delano\\'s rural adventures, but its main purpose is to (again) foreshadow the coming dangers. The result is good [7/10]. \\n Last Man Standing (110-114). I have mixed feelings about this Jenkins arc. On the one hand, I love the integration of the Arthurian mythos and the continued focus on the magic of Britain. I also quite like its ties to Rich, while Dani is a great addition to the cast, and a nice (and necessary) move past Kit. \\n On the other hand, the plotting feels muddled.

This anniversary issue does its best to offer a unique experience, but it\\'s desperately seeking something all right: a plot.

In it he brought together Archimedes, Newton, Jabir ibn Hayyan, Nostradamus, and Zhang Heng and Tesla (to name just a few) from our \"real\" world and mixed them with Nathaniel Richard and Howard Stark (the fathers, respectively, of Mr. Fantastic and Iron Man) to synthesize one of Marvel\\'s most interesting comics in years. Even when Hickman falls short, as in the \"Manhattan Project\" (in which the atomic bomb is the least interesting creation of world\\'s great minds, here reimagined as drunks, space aliens, lunatics etc), one cannot but be impressed. Now with \"East of West,\" Hickman has introduced yet another world, one totally new and staggering in its scope. \\n A fantastical fantasy masquerading as an alternative history, \"East of West\" takes place in a future (2064) dystopian North America divided in seven separate states (nominally Union, Confederate, Native American, Texan, Chinese, etc). Twenty-Sixty-Four could be 3064 or 20,064 for all it would matter. This is a world awash in high technology, mysticism and mutants. The cultural flavor varies but we spend most of our time in a futuristic old West (think Butch and Sundance riding robot horses) and eventually the Chinese empire (ruled by Emperor Mao V). \\n As the book opens, a nameless lone white figure rises from the earth. Then we see him in cowboy regalia on a killing spree. Shortly after, three children (horsemen of the Apocalypse) rise from the same place and we come to understand that the white cowboy is Death and here is for vengeance (though it takes us a while to understand for what). As usual Hickman serves up plenty of metaphor and visual humor. Here artist Nick Dragotta work stands out as just amazing. While I\\'ve seen his stuff before, I don\\'t recall ever being so impressed. Possibly Hickman\\'s work more than others requires just this sort of fine artistic match to bring his stories to life (as Waver did so well in SHIELD). \\n Lots of reviewers have reasonably complained that this series can be confusing. I suspect this is triply so if you read it in issue format. Indeed, I can\\'t recall the last comic that seems to ill-suited to being served in such short chapters (Vaugn\\'s \"Saga\" comes to mind as a close second, though for all its oddness, that is still a straight forward Romeo/Juliet story). No, this is a series meant for a longer form. Reading the five issues included in this volume, most of the initial questions are answered in ways that intrigue and made me want more. While the world at first appeared vast enough to provoke agoraphobia, Hickman\\'s virtuosity left me wholly confident that he knows where we\\'re going and it\\'s a trip I don\\'t want to miss.'),\n",

       "  \"Nova: Dark Reign (Nova #1-3). The first issue of the Nova appropriately shows the aftermath of Annihilation Omnibus, but then the story takes a rather surprising detour to Earth in the middle of Norman Osbourne's Dark Reign. It's a rarity, seeing this iteration of the Nova comic interacting with Earth, and it's interesting seeing how far Richard has moved beyond these Earthly concerns [7/10]. \\n Conquest: Prologue. DnA do a great job of giving the newest threat to the galaxy an epic feel, while steel keeping the story very human. An enthralling start! [8/10]. \\n Nova: The Early Conquest (Nova #4-7). These early issues of Nova do a good job of continuing the epic scope of the Conquest while also giving us the personal stories of both Richard and the new Nova, Ko-rel (who is great!). It's a wonderful balance and one that has very nice closure with the last issue, as Nova's Conquest story enters a new stage ... and we branch out to the stories of others ... [7+/10]. \\n Star-Lord. The Star-Lord miniseries nicely bridges Star-Lord's past through Annihilation and sets up the Star-Lord who'll become famous on the big screen. More notably, it gathers together a pretty cool group of space heroes ... who turn out to be the Guardians of the Galaxy! Woot! Yeah, there's a plot here about Phalanx viruses, but it's all these characters who make the story [7/10]. \\n Quasar. Phyla is a great character because she embodies the legacy of both Captain Marvel and Quasar, and this mini-series takes advantage of all of that, with a well-defined Moondragon only adding to the fun. On the downside, the whole story is a long macguffin quest meant to advance Conquest by a single plot point, and it also features endless battles against the Super Adaptoid (literally, one per issue). These unfortunately drag the story [6/10]. \\n Wraith. Who is Wraith? What does he want? This questions keep the first few issues of Wraith going. But once we learn that that answers involve science-fiction gobblidigook and a simple revenge fantasy, the mini-series loses most of its interest. Even when we get attention to Ronin and Super-Skrull, two of the stars from Annihilation, it isn't enough to save this series which is ultimately dull, and the worst of the Annihilation: Conquest sequence. I also don't feel like it's paid off well enough down the line. [5/10]. \\n Knowhere (Nova #8-9). Right in the middle of Conquest and DnA introduces Knowhere. Yowza! The concept of the place is cool and Cosmo is cool, but we don't actually get a sense of the society yet due to the chaos. And the story itself is a fight against an otherwise unknown beasty [6+/10]. \\n Vore (Nova #10). This is a great model for Nova: picaresque stories of dangers across the galaxy. The weird environ makes for a fun story, but it's the personal interactions with Gamora that bring it up to the next level [7/10]. \\n Dreams (Nova Annual #1). This is a rather sneaky piece of writing, mixing a supposed past and future into a compelling and mysterious story. In the end it ends up being totally irrelevant: you could skip from #10 to #11 without missing a beat. But it's too much fun to do that (and nicely revisits Richard's origins as Nova too) [8/10]. \\n Kvch (Nova #11-12). Richard's magical mystery tour concludes with a visit to Kvch, the home of the technarchy. And Warlock! Now I've never understood the relationships between Phalanx and Warlock's people, but it's great to have Warlock in the story, offering the opportunity to better bring these two concepts together. The story of what Warlock's been doing and how it turns out is also quite enjoyable [7+/10]. \\n Annihilation Conquest (AC #1-6). The mini-series that closes things off is a nice epic story. DnA embed it with major plot beats but also do a great job of touching upon old continuity. There's not as much characterization as I'd like here, particularly when compared to the Nova stories, but the primordial Guardians of the Galaxy do get some good attention. Overall, a good finale to this cosmic event [7/10]. \\n Overall, Annihilation Conquest is a rather impressive balancing job of bringing together a whole bunch of miniseries into a coherent whole. Some of those series are eager than DnA's main work ... but so it goes. This is still a fun series that creates a whole galaxy of possibilities.\"),\n",

He was thoroughly domesticated, and so no longer the character that had won his popularity in the X-Men. Millar changed that with a simple twist: he made Wolverine into a villain. Now other writers, past and present, have tried this route to his little success. But Millar made it believable and total with Hand brainwashing, and the result is one of the best Wolverine saga ever. \\n Wolverine is a beast again, a force of nature. He goes toe-to-toe with Marvel's best, and even against foes like The Thing, the outcome is in question. Now you can't maintain this status quo for too long without it getting stale, and Millar knows when to stop. But then he pulls a great trick: even when Wolverine is back on the side of angels, he remains that unstoppable force of nature. It's like a trip to the dark side has returned Wolverine's essential self. \\n To a large extent this story isn't deep. But it's action-adventure at its best. I'm often not a fan of the extended battle sequences, but Millar manages to maintain their tension by creating a story of things gone horribly wrong where anything could happen. \\n And these issues also have Romita artwork to die for! [8/10] \\n I'm also impressed by how much this arc now feels like a setup for the Secret Warriors comic. \\n Prisoner Number Zero (32). a nice little one-off that feels more like a ghost story than anything else.

I have read several graphic novels in the past but never a \"super hero\" one. I am not much of a comic book fan either, so Watchmen was new territory for me in many ways. \\n I also read Watchmen because one of my book clubs selected Junot Diaz\\'s The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao. I\\'ve been told that the lead character in that book is a fan of Watchmen. I figured I would read Watchmen to get better character insight for Diaz\\'s book. \\n I didn\\'t know much about the story of Watchmen before I started reading it. The \"present day\" in the novel is 1985 (which was around when the book was written) and superheros have been banned. America is also on the brink of a nuclear war with Russia. The story flashes between 1985 and stories of superheros from the 1940\\'s and 1970\\'s. In 1985, several superheros are showing up dead. The story is dark and pessimistic. The characters know that the world is approaching disaster and seem to have little if any hope of saving it. \\n In Watchmen, only one of the \"superheroes\" has a true super power. The rest are regular people who decided to become a masked hero. Moore did a good job of showing us the psychology of superheros-why different people make the decision to don a mask and costume. Some do it for fame, some for power, some to fight, and some to try to make the world a better place. The book makes you ask questions like what is good and what is evil? do the ends always justify the means? and of course... what would my superhero costume look like? ;) \\n Watchmen is considered a classic of the genre and I am glad that I\\'ve read it. It won the 1988 Hugo Award. I probably won\\'t rush out to buy and read more superhero graphic novels, but if one happens to mysteriously land on my to-read pile, I would read it.'),\n",

They read more like scenes from the show that never aired. There are scenes that include not only Oliver but also his supporting cast. \\n This is an enjoyable read. I was surprised how much I enjoyed the stories considering their length. Even in the short space the message was easily conveyed. I actually liked the stories about the supporting cast more than the stories about the main character. The stories about Diggle, Laurel, or Sara was a nice peek into their character before we see them in the show. The stories about Oliver were more about him defeating the bad guys so they basically did not bring anything new to the table. \\n I had to deduct a star in my rating because of the artwork. I didn't think it was the best as the characters did not resemble the actors who play them.

It is during this middle school to high school transition period that students are just fine-tuning their abilities to create pictures in their minds of what they read--something brain science tells us is the difference between a good reader and a poor reader.

Well, I love all the mangas written and illustrated by Minami Kanan, especially if they have smut in their genres. She is just fabulous at drawing such things, and her main characters, guys especially are really big perverts, but that just makes them even more amazing. And you just can't not fall in love with them. You'll just drool all over your manga while reading. \\n There is only one word to describe this manga: best hardcore shoujo. Oh, those were two words, but well it's an amazing shoujo manga. It starts with an absolutely unpopular girl and a popular boy falling in love with each other. Well, their relationship didn't really start that smooth, both of them kind of hated each other in the beginning, they did have their reasons. Everything does start with a quite bad start, but very soon both of them find themselves deeply in love with each other. But will their love be enough to overcome what is waiting for them in the future? That's up to you to find out. \\n The characters are amazing, especially their development. Both Tsubaki and Kyouta have a long way to go. And all their feelings are shown in this manga; their fears and their joys, their love and also their sorrow. The manga covers a really huge part of their lives. One of the best parts is when they break up so Tsubaki can find what she wants to do in the future. Manga focuses quite excessively on the future and that not all of us know what we want to do, as well as that we should follow our dreams, and we should fight for them and even stand up to our parents to make them understand that it is our lives, not theirs. \\n Now let me just explain one thing before I finish up here. This is something with their names. You might have a problem getting why they are called every time differently. In Japan using a person's first name means you are very close to this somebody, so it is common that in mangas sometimes people call each other by their family names. So now back to my explanation. The heroine's name is Tsubaki Shibano, while the hero's name is Kyouta Tsubaki. Meaning Tsubaki for a girl is first name, while for a boy a surname. Hope, you will not be confused after reading this. \\n You will enjoy this manga a lot. It has everything. A lot of love, but quite a big portion of heartbreak too, nice humor and a lot of every day life problems. The characters are amazing. They impress you from the very first page and you don't really want to put the manga down until you finish it. I hope you enjoy it to its fullest\"),\n",

       "  \"** spoiler alert ** \\n '1910', the latest (2009) in Alan Moore's 'The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen' is a bit of a potboiler by any standards. As usual, Moore assumes an in-depth knowledge in the reader of the highways and byways of past popular and esoteric culture, but whereas, in the past, the jumbling of images and themes appeared to be both coherent and instructive, here it is just showy. \\n It is as if Moore was making sure that he got in all the references in '1910' that were left over from previous works. What next '1920' with cute references to Crowley, Rohmer and Buchan. '1930' with a young Auden coming up against Junger, Evola and various characters from the Waugh novels? Und so weiter ... This Moorcockian conceit is in danger of becoming tired without the offer of some deeper message behind it. As with early Moorcock, it is more style and self-indulgence than substance and meaning. \\n Moore's work is here much like his character of Orlando, a gender-changing immortal but also a thorough bore who drops names from the past like the worst sort of metropolitan socialite. The graphic novel is saved by the illustrator, Kevin O'Neill, who takes this relatively lazy material and creates some arresting images - the naked daughter of Captain Nemo more at home at sea than on land is creatively transformed into victim and then brutal heir to her father's domain as much through draughtsmanship as penmanship. Not great but good. \\n But, as always, with Moore, we are judging him here by the high standards of his own past. He is still a cut above most graphic novelists even when he fails. This story is consciously Brechtian and bleak, one in which a localised catastrophe is mistaken by these paranormal investigators, who strike me as rather bumbling compared to previous incarnations, for the one yet to come: the holocaust that started in 1914. We know it is coming. They don't. And yet they are supposed to be more prescient than us. \\n This leads us to the strange mood of the piece - one of despair. Alan Moore has always been quintessentially British in his sensibility. This means, in fantasy terms, either dystopian (as in 'V for Vendetta' or 'Watchmen') or hopefully occult (as in 'Promethea'). In '1910', there is a lot of dystopianism and very little of the occult. The bad guys are the winners, bad acts only get punished through cathartic violence and lies protect the aristocratic order. \\n This sounds like Moore has captured perfectly the quiet rage now bubbling under the surface of Middle England in the wake of the credit crisis and political lies and failures. This rage is sometimes palpable in England today, especially amongst the older generation of the middling sort who foolishly trusted these people in office and in the City. It is a rage that floats between depression and violence and graphic novels do not do depression very well - the rage's impulse is thus towards violence in a comic book world where serial killers and pirates are looked on cynically as no worse than the system they declare war on, where ordinary humans are little more than rats and where apocalyptic violence seems both inevitable and purgative. \\n What Moore has done, perhaps in a fit of absent-mindedness but as an aspect of his genius, is capture the psyche of Western culture as we move into a period of extreme scarcity for some and the destruction of dreams for many others while the system itself seems to continue with all the momentum of a steam engine whose crew has long since bailed out but which managed to leave sufficient coal in the boiler. \\n So, not a great work but already a work of our time and one that, more than the literary outpourings of metropolitan London society, should act as a warning that the street revolt that brought the vicious BNP into the European Parliament only a few months ago may scarcely have begun.\"),\n",

Sam Wilson is one of the best men in the Marvel Universe. If Captain America is worthy to carry Thor's hammer, Sam is the only man I can think of who is worthy to carry Cap's shield.

       "  \"This book is a cross between a picture book and a graphic novel, though it leans more into the graphic novel camp and is intended for an audience older than the picture book crowd. As a memoir, it's message is inherently biased. I personally don't have any issue with that, but readers need to understand the purpose of creative nonfiction in order to really grasp this book. \\n Creative nonfiction (i.e. personal essay & memoir) seeks to convey a universal message by telling one individual's personal story. In this case, the universal message is about the dictatorial control and censorship of a communist regime, the suspicion and fear created by that type of government, and the lack of opportunities that results from making and enforcing blanket anti-individualistic policies. You can even take that a step broader and apply the message to all forms of government control of individual freedoms in cases where those liberties are not threatening anyone's health or safety or imposing on others in any significantly negative way. \\n If you need a barbed-wire wall and 24-hour armed guards to keep people contained, we can assume that something is terribly wrong. This book allows us a glimpse behind the barbed wire, an opportunity not available to most of us through experiential means. For me that glimpse was instructional, moving, and eye-opening. So I think this book succeeds spectacularly as a nonfiction offering for tweens and teens, especially since most young people would also have no way to experience that level of government control for themselves. \\n My one complaint about this book, and it is a minor one, is the redundancy created by the journal entries. I understand why they were included; we obtain some additional information from them and they also allow a more direct connection with the author, the person whose story we are immersed in. But by clumping them together on the same page spread, we read the same thing twice in many cases - in the journal entry and then again in the graphic panels. Perhaps the journal entries could have been presented differently. \\n This book is not just a memoir; it is a graphic memoir, which means that much of its message is conveyed through the art. In that regard, it is an artistic triumph. The limited color palette on many of the pages is quite effective.\"),\n",

Rabagliati is most famous for his fairly autobiographical Paul series, The Song of Roland being the story of the life of Paul\\'s father-in-law. The original book is Paul a Quebec, and I\\'m not quite sure why they took such liberties in the translation of the title, perhaps to make allusions to the epic poem of the same name? But, then why not do that in French as well? Anyway, Paul is now married and in his 40s with a young daughter, and during Roland\\'s illness, he gets to see the man behind the grandpa, and to see how this man came from nothing and built a family. \\n I don\\'t know much about art styles, but Rabagliati\\'s seems to conform to a great tradition of black and white graphic novelists in CanLit such as Bryan Lee O\\'Malley, Chester Brown, and Jeff Lemire. It also conforms to the rounder-edged, more minimalist styles of many graphic artists who tell slice of life/family drama stories, such as some of the above, and Hope Larson (Mercury), Marjane Satrapi (Persepolis), and Alison Bechdel (Dykes to Watch Out For and creator of the Bechdel Test). I\\'ve seen this referred to as \"European cartoon style,\" I suppose in reference to Tin Tin and Asterix. Perhaps that\\'s where the style came from, but I think these family dramas have their own unique style that is quite different from that of Tin Tin. I\\'m not normally a huge fan of this rounder-edged style, but for some reason, I find it very much suits the stories Rabagliati chooses to tell. Something about the softer faces conveys both the nostalgia with which he writes, and somehow throws the harsher times in his life into sharp relief. In this particular book, I really loved a dream sequence that was beautifully tense and heartbreaking. \\n The first thing I noted about the story of Roland\\'s life was that, in contrast to many stories about men\\'s lives - especially those about men who came from nothing - this is not a story of the business/empire he built, but of the family he built. Roland, whose history contains a distinct lack of familial connections, managed to understand that family was what he needed, and how to make building one a priority. In turn, his daughters now know how to foster a family, and Paul gets to feel included in one for the good times and the bad. I always enjoy the way Rabagliati portrays the jumble of large families, with all their joys, annoyances, frustrations, traditions and sadness, and TSOR is his best work yet in that regard. There is a pot smoking scene with the 3 sisters taking care of their dad that actually had me doing the same \"relief laugh\" as they were. You know, the great big (often inappropriate) laugh that sometimes happens in the middle of tough times that just helps you let go a bit? \\n The best words for Rabagliati\\'s work that I can come up with are touching and nostalgic. if you\\'re in the mood for that, especially in regards to family, then I would highly recommend picking up any one of his Paul books, especially The Song of Roland.'),\n",

Both The Forge and The Casting does not revamp a universe by throwing expendable elements into the bin and starting with a clean slate like what most Crises in DC, but instead lets the readers know that all of them have existed. These two issues act as a foyer of a new DC structure - the doors are opened for its readers enter in DC Universe Rebirth, now we are introduced to the vastness of this world as we gaze upon the different things and characters this comics giant has to offer. \\n Duke finally gets a name in this issue, and no it\\'s not bat or bird related. \\n But reintroducing these concepts and characters, together with telling an effective story is nothing but a tall order for the creative team. Thankfully, DC Metal is helmed by Scott Snyder. This man here is a master of storytelling and effective, well-researched exposition (just read his New 52 Batman run). The resulting prelude issues, though many elements may cause confusion to us readers lay a solid foundation on what DC has to offer. \\n Spoilers follow: \\n Dark Days and the upcoming DC Metal I suppose would explain why the DC Universe has their own version of mutants and mutates. Perhaps explaining why Basil Karlo acquired the power and became Clayface and did not die, why Joker swam in a toxic chemical vat and did not die, why Barry Allen was doused in chemicals, struck by lightning and did not die, why Swamp Thing and Animal Man became champions of The Green and Red respectively. All because they have this Nth Metal in their blood. This has been introduced in this issue thanks to Joker\\'s exposition and little experiment with Duke. Remember the test he was mentioned only has four flags: M-E-T-A, it strongly suggested that it is supposed to be M-E-T-A-L. This Nth Metal also gives powers to weapons. Like the Sunblade and that Shazam dagger. \\n What we don\\'t know is the extent of influence of the metal, although it is suggested that it is something big for it to get the attention of the Guardians of the Universe. Also, do Bruce Wayne and Oliver Queen also have Nth Metal in their blood? Is Hal Jordan and the other Lanterns chosen not only because of their willpower but also because they have this element inside them? \\n These evil Batmen is a trademark Scott Snyder technique. It\\'s like the Court of Owls but bigger and deeper. I\\'m excited to see what is their connection with the Nth Metal and the Dionesium (and is Nth Metal the Dionesium?) \\n There are other elements that I don\\'t understand in the story. The thing is, Snyder and the team reintroduces these elements, recognizing the fact that the DC Universe Rebirth era does not erase these things in their timeline.'),\n",

The way in way Alec\\'s humanity seems to be coming and going throughout this Swamp Thing series is frankly befuddling (and something that probably wasn\\'t helped by the changing writing teams). \\n Sadly the last issue in this volume (20) is then another confusing mess. \\n And where are Abby and Tefe in all of this? Who knows! Swamp Thing\\'s supporting cast appears to have been abruptly jettisoned. \\n Unfortunately, this volume as a whole is a half-baked mess that barely makes sense.

Reborn is always good to look at, whether you are looking at the lush green faerie forests of the good side, or the bloody rotten world filled with evil denizens. \\n Unfortunately, the whole Reborn series has one fundamental flaw: Mark Millar has not until now established a convincing world.

The character studies in this mini-series are wonderful and often full of heart. \\n However, this comic is truly great because it's one of the great superhero deconstructions of the '80s, right up there with Miracle Man, The Watchmen, and The Dark Knight. It imagines what heroes would do if they were going to change the world and what they would do if faced with human foibles. So Dr. Spectrum (Green Lantern) is more self-absorbed and selfish than Hal Jordon ever was; Nuke (Firestorm) is actually radioactive and causing the death of his parents; and Tom Thumb (Atom) is unsure of his place in the Squadron. The list goes on. \\n The plot of changing the world is a great one, because it's the sort of thing that superheroes should think of, but it was rarely even considered in earlier Ages. The Squadron Supreme may be the most complete investigation ever of the trope. It's not surprising that it inevitably leads the Fight of the Titans that also seems common in deconstructionist superhero stories of this type ... but Greenwald doesn't pull any punches, and the result is tense and heart breaking. \\n By the time you get done with this mini-series, your mood should be hovering somewhere between awe and the desire to read more [10/10].\"),\n",

       "  \"The Realm was part of the black & white comic explosion of the '80s, but unlike the many Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle pastiches and satires, The Realm went in a direction that was little seen in comics at the time: fantasy. To be specific, it focuses on the popular '80s trope of modern-day mundie teenagers lost in a fantasy realm. \\n The Realms' fantasy is clearly based on Dungeons & Dragons, and perhaps even the D&D cartoon which started with the same trope (though it's also reminiscent of Guardians of the Flame: The Warriors). In any case, our mundie teenagers take on the roles of a fighter, a magic-user, and a cleric, then they're joined by an elf, a dwarf, and a hobbit-like halfling. That's pretty much the Basic D&D classes (minus a thief). They even fight a D&D set of low-level humanoids: goblins, hobgoblins, and orcs. \\n The scripting of these issues is a little rough, especially the first issue which has some pretty bad dialogue. But that picks up quickly. \\n I should warn that I have real nostalgia for these issues. I read them when they came out in the '80s, paying a premium for the first two issues, then avidly collecting them as they jumped from one publisher to another ... but with that said, I still think there's a lot to like here. \\n First, this was some of the earliest work of Guy Davis, and he knocks it out of the park with beautiful and unique black & white illustrations. \\n Second, despite its foundation in standard D&D tropes, the world is quite unique too. Villains include a rising tide of undead and an Asian-influenced baddie, both of them far from the norms of the era's fantasy. \\n Third, the bad guys get great focus, as we meet both Darkon and Zarkoth here. \\n Fourth, the larger-scale plotting is quite interesting, as one of the kids is immediately swept away from the rest. This gives a shape to the first four issues, as the others quest for her, but it also creates an interesting division in the group (and is what allows the comic to focus on those aforementioned villains). \\n Overall, the strong plotting and world creation of The Realm are enough to offset the poor scripting, creating an interesting read. \\n It was delightful to discover that Arrow and Caliber had preserved a few small trade paperbacks of this classic series.\"),\n",

When Comixology.com recently had the entire World War Hulk series on sale - I jumped at the chance! \\n In brief, Tony Stark (Ironman) and others (Fantastic Four, Black Bolt et al.) trick the Hulk And banish him to Sakaar - a distant planet. In a separate story arc, the Hulk becomes a more fearsome warrior, becomes a king, marries and is about to become a father. Events on this planet (not told in this graphic novel) cause him to lose everything he had fought for, cherished and loved. He then finds a spacecraft, which he pilots back to Earth...Filled with rage, he seeks revenge on that banished him!! \\n Positively, I was most impressed with the artwork. The artists (Romita and Janson) aptly capture the battle scenes with much action and energy. You can feel the power and anger of the Hulk as he lays into his enemies! \\n On the other hand, having recently read The Dark Knight Rises and Court of Owls - I must say I was a little disappointed with the writing and storytelling. Wave after wave of superheroes take on the Hulk with various results - it did become a little tedious after a while. While the artwork was a visual treat, the writing did feel clunky and awkward at times. There was either too little or too much exposition from secondary characters. \\n While this was my first Hulk graphic novel and exposure to writer, Greg Pak, I will not be put off by this particular story arc - it did leave me wanting to learn more.

It is bulky to accommodate all this: well over 300 pages. At certain points we get illustrated short lectures on aspects of the graphic tradition, including a remarkable analysis of Hogarth's Gin and Beer Lane prints and an account of the role of Ally Sloper in popular culture. \\n He is mindful of American readers with the odd tale of links between Sunderland and the Americas but these come naturally and at no point can it be said that he panders to commercial expectations. Sometimes, as with the best graphic material, the book can be seen as a film documentary until one realises that much of the raw visual content and the subtle effect of simultaneity of images could not be reproduced in any other medium. \\n This is triumph of the graphic design tradition and a worthy contribution from the United Kingdom that places Bryan Talbot up there with Alan Moore as a master of the genre.\"),\n",

       "  'Why is Watchmen considered as one of the greatest creations in not only graphic literature, but in literature in general? It is certainly not the best. We readers are our own subjective tastes. I can give you a list of graphic novels I have read that entertained me more than Watchmen. Alan Moore can be easily beaten by another writer in creativity. Dave Gibbons isn\\'t the best comic book artist of all time. \\n So why is this book, and I will go far with my words, is revered by many as one of the greatest, if not greatest of all time? That it is an iconoclastic and sacrilegious for someone to even touch and more so, expand its lore? Sure, it is era-defining. Watchmen is a definitive example of comic book culture maturity. Certainly, it touches on geo-socio-political events worldwide, depicted so effective and so organic that the things happening in this book are very believable, even though the main characters are nowhere to be seen in the real world. Of yeah, Alan Moore has crafted these Watchmen crimebusters as archetypes of nearly all superheroes in existence: a god, a techie vigilante, an anti-hero vigilante, an uber-cool vigilante, a fan-service heroine and a villain-hero (but honestly, you don\\'t have a Deadpool in Watchmen). \\n So again, why? \\n This is my personal take on it: Watchmen is full of multi-thematic elements, told effectively in a self-contained story. This book has a say on almost anything about comic books, in many levels. Think about a theme in comic books, Watchmen would most likely have it. Simple themes would be godlike heroes, villain-hero relationships, salvation, vigilante, love and sex, crimebusting partners, and the list can go on. How about human frailty, the concept of life in the eyes of a god, the power of media, the repercussions of war, man\\'s apathy on the things going on around him, deliverance from global conflict? I\\'m not saying that Watchmen has everything. In just covers a lot in its twelve issues. We can appreciate it in many levels: As an entertainment material, indeed you will be entertained without thinking too much about it. As a graphic novel, yeah it is great. As a piece worthy of academic discourse, yeah you can do that too. Every detail is important, every object has a story, everything, the Black Freighter, the hentai octopus giant monster, the smiley pin, the placard, even the Hollis Mason trophy is a piece of conversation. \\n If someone tweaks, or adds something in the Watchmen lore, it is perfectly understandable that people would react, with some finding it sacrilegious. Perfectly understandable. I myself abhorred the idea of a Before Watchmen series (at first), disappointed with the ending of the Snyder\\'s Watchmen film (but enjoyed it) and a bit skeptical (and excited at the same time) with Watchmen\\'s incarnation in the mainstream DC universe. Why? Because this book is self-contained. I don\\'t say that it is error-proof, or all loose ends are tied. Watchmen can just stand on its own. It is one big solid quilt where everything is connected. It has its flaws but far too light too bring the whole graphic novel down. \\n Pick something from Watchmen, anything, and you can get a piece of conversation from it. Review a certain aspect of the graphic novel and you will be astonished on how so many things you can say with that just single aspect. Or you can just say \"I enjoyed it so much\", and it is perfectly okay. Alan Moore\\'s Watchmen is about so many things. It is an essential literary work that everybody should read.'),\n",

       "  'Up until now, Scott Snyder\\'s excellent run of Batman has focused largely on exploring the rich history of Gotham. The Court of Owls will no doubt continue to cast shadows over Batman\\'s city for years to come. Now, Snyder has chosen to take a far bolder step, by returning to topics already well-trodden by some of the all-time great comic writers. A Batman origin story titled \"Zero Year\" cannot but evoke memories of Frank Miller\\'s iconic year one. And, as \"Zero Year\" centers on Bruce Wayne donning the cape after he\\'s been out-maneuvered by a sinister anonymous genius in the Red Hood, we likewise must recall the still evocative \"Killing Joke.\" I\\'ve long considered Snyder one of the best writers in the DC bullpen, but I still can\\'t but be amazed by the sheer audacity of boldly reworking material already covered by Miller and Moore. And, as much as I wanted to resist \"Zero Year,\" by the end Snyder had me totally under his spell. \\n As with \"Year One,\" Snyder\\'s origin gives us a Bruce Wayne trained and newly returned to Gotham, committed to his war on crime yet unsure of how best to accomplish his mission. Yet instead of the various crime families and corruption of Miller\\'s work, Snyder\\'s Wayne funds the Red Hood, a mysterious villain bent on demolishing the city. Since we are at the beginning, we likewise see Bruce and Alfred\\'s testy relationship as it restarts. Here Alfred doesn\\'t so much disapprove of Bruce\\'s goals as he does of his pre-Batman methods, believing that Gotham needs a symbol. Snyder also resurrects certain older characters, such as Batman\\'s uncle Philip Kane. \\n Where Snyder best hits his mark, however, is with the villains. Familiar readers know the Red Hood\\'s ultimate fate and \"Zero Year\" sets this up brilliantly, the Hood demonstrating both genius and madness as well as a carefully maintained anonymity. Indeed, my major complaint about this book is Snyder\\'s decision - I presume - to toss the classic Red Hood mask in favor of a tall half mask. Hard to take a master villain seriously, no matter how murderous, when he at best looks like a roller pen. The other stand out villain here is Edward Nigma, not yet become the Riddler, but given his rightful place at the dawning of the Batman legend. While many quite rightly understand the Joker at Batman\\'s spiritual dark reflection, Snyder recognizes that Nigma is the reflection of Batman\\'s intellect. I for one was thrilled to see him at last get his due. \\n A final and excellent bonus are the Batman \"training\" stories. Again, other readers have looked at this period of Bruce Wayne\\'s pre-Batman life before, but it makes for some excellent reading here as backup material. \\n With \"Zero Year\" Snyder takes a bold step in putting his own mark on the more than half-century old Batman legend. It was a risky move - the writer could have fallen flat. Instead, he mostly soars.'),\n",

I can't help but think that the universe would be served better by the two comics being differentiated, but lacking that, they really should be acknowledged as a single narrative (like Superman was back in the '90s) and collected as a single narrative. \\n Speaking of collections, it's nice that DC didn't give us another fractured crossover, but wholly duplicating a six-issue crossover into two different volumes is bad too. It's really not that hard to map out collections so that crossovers fall between them, but DC seems intent on NOT doing so, apparently because they want to have (nearly) complete collections of all their Nu52 titles.

But once again, the actual writing doesn't stand up to those ideas. An Eradicator with closer than ever ties to Krypton? Pretty cool. An Eradicator who fights with Superdad for multiple issues? Not great. \\n So overall I love the direction things are going, and dearly, dearly hope that Superdad has settled in as the real Superman of the NuNu52.

Punisher and Batman have almost the same origin story and the same calculated and almost clinical approach to what they do. The difference is that Batman wrestles with the choice all the time. Punisher has left choice behind: There's nothing he can do except gun down criminals.

Its clearly drawn characters, its interesting mysteries, and its non-conventional storytelling have all contributed to a great story that always leaves me wanting more. Unfortunately, that story hasn't been served well by Image's trade paperback format. Not only have the arcs been getting longer, but Image's trade paperbacks have also been getting shorter, and that's resulted in collections that are less and less comprehensible. So, I decided to trade up for the Deluxe hardcovers, both because they were nicer and longer. \\n Volumes 1 and 2 of the TPBs, which are collected here, are the arcs that really worked on their own. The first part tells the story of a group of six new students come to Morning Glory Academy. Then, the second part delves into their backgrounds while introducing some new mysteries and edging forward the story. Surprisingly, it all works even better as one book. Now, the ongoing plot is that much clearer, and the two halves of the volume form a great reflection, showing these characters in the modern day and the past. \\n Spencer is truly working toward the long game here, so it's no surprise that Morning Glories gets better the more deeply you immerse yourself in its world.\"),\n",

       "  'The Starlord (Preview 4). Englehart\\'s original story is really impressively classic SF, like the exploration science fiction of the \\'40s by authors such as Doc Smith. This whole (long) issue is just an origin, but it\\'s nicely done with great characterization all the way, revealing who this Peter Quill is. It anticlimaxes a bit at the end, which smooshes the resolution into just a few pages, but otherwise this remains a very intriguing piece. It also offers a few bits of Star-Lord lore which are interesting in retrospective such as: the character lives in the future, not in contemporary Marvel Earth; he\\'s empowered by an old man who looks like the wizard from Shazam!; and he\\'s implied to be one of many Starlords. Oh, and the art is beautiful [7/10]. \\n Second Launch (Preview 11). Claremont\\'s intro is a rather large change. The thoughtful, well-characterized SF is gone, replaced by space action-adventure and planetary romance. We\\'ve moved from the \\'40s or \\'50s to the \\'60s or \\'70s, and stories like EC Tubb\\'s Dumarest of Terra ... or Star Wars. In fact, this story rather prefigures Star Wars with a Sith-Lord(!) and \"Peter Jason Quill ... I am your father\".(!) With that said, it\\'s not as good as Engelhart\\'s original. The adventuresome element of it leaves it pretty shallow. Only the ending on Sparta is really a surprise (and something that continues to be a crucial element of Star-Lord to this day) because of Claremont\\'s nice reimagination of elements from Engelhart\\'s origin [5+/10] \\n Sand Story (Preview 14). A ship that takes a human form? A sentient hive mind that\\'s waiting to be reborn? This is definitely some high-concept SF that continues in the mold of the \\'60s, and it\\'s well done (if a little slow at times) [6/10]. \\n A Matter of Necessity (Preview 15). Claremont flirted with space opera in his previous stories, but this is the one where he embraces it most whole-heartedly, making it the heart of the story, rather than just an excuse for action-adventure. Mind you, it\\'s a wacky space opera with sentient suns, which is very \\'60s. The story itself, of warring cultures is good, and the revelation of ship\\'s origins is interesting. [6+/10] \\n World in a Bottle (Super-Special 10). Moench\\'s first take on Star-Lord is the most science-fiction-y of all, pushing even harder toward space opera. It\\'s a fun story with black holes, ark ships, and a bit of romance that\\'s only problem is that it explains too much at times. Oh, and it has the first Star-Lord color art, and it\\'s beautiful [7/10]. \\n Less Than Human (Preview 18). Moenech\\'s second take is much more \\'meh\\'. It\\'s a really standard planetary romance story that almost could have been written for Dumarest of Terra. Moenech has to temporarily do away with Ship to make it work, and that feels as artificial as you\\'d expect. The only good point is a big bit of characterization for Starlord, but we\\'ll see if it holds [5/10]. \\n The Saga Begins (Spotlight 6). As Star-Lord makes the transition from magazines and comics, Moenech gives us another retelling of his origin. It\\'s nice to get the original story and the Claremont retcons in one place, but it\\'s not that interesting. I\\'m also not thrilled by the retcon that the Master of the Sun is not a star, but a lizard [3/10]. \\n Heaven & Planet (Spotlight 7, Premiere 61). The last two classic stories both suffer from the same flaws: they are so in-love with presenting a deeply-imagined alien culture that they\\'re not actually interesting. And so Moenech\\'s run and the Starlord of the \\'80s come to an end [4/10]. \\n Zahn\\'s Starlord (Starlord 1-3). Starlord finally gets his own comic ... and it\\'s not about Peter Quill at all. Instead we get a newcomer, Sinjin, who is tasked by ship to take on Peter\\'s role until they can find him ... and the story is as delightful as that premise sounds. Sinjin is a great character who I quickly became more invested in than Quill because he feels more human. The comic also has great background, with a realistic-feeling galactic society that includes telepathy and other delights. (Zahn has said that he was trying to make the series more SF and less superhero.) I\\'m not fond of retcons about the elemental gun, but otherwise this is a nice next-story for Starlord; a pity it seems to have been entirely ignored since. [7+/10]. \\n Overall, I was shocked that Star-Lord was so heavily SF in its early existence, and also pretty good. However, this feels like quite a different character from the Quill of Annihilation onward.'),\n",

However, even I am aware of the classic episode The City on the Edge of Forever from the original Star Trek series. \\n Written by speculative fiction master Harlan Ellison, the episode is praised as one of the greatest that the franchise has ever produced. Despite all of this, Ellison was notoriously furious with it and the changes that were made to his screenplay. \\n Adapted by brother duo Scott and David Tipton, who are responsible for many of the Star Trek graphic novels produced by IDW Publishing, this graphic novel stays remarkably close to the original script by Ellison. \\n Much of the narrative from the episode is unchanged. A crew member beams down to an unknown planet and encounters a time portal to 1930s America. Through his actions the course of history is changed, requiring Kirk and Spock to also travel through time in order to set things right. \\n The changes that were made to the story are subtle--the most notable being that in this adaptation the crew member wasn\\'t the lovable McCoy but a character named Beckwith. The narrative still focusses on theological, philosophical, and moral dilemmas highlighting themes of loss, determinism, and the \"hero complex\"--the desire to save everyone. \\n The art by J.K.

Made to look like screen-capped tableaus from the original episode, each panel has the aesthetic of a 1967 oil painting.

While Hamlet accepts the commission, he quickly realizes that all is not what it at first seems; A group of Richard\\'s subjects, known as Prodigals, are in open rebellion, led by Juliet, Othello, and Falstaff. \\\\ \\n The premise will no doubt bring Bill Willingham\\'s \"Fables\" to mind for many readers. Kill Shakespeare likewise takes well known characters and tries to combine and grown them in ways both entertaining and unexpected. Just as I won\\'t be the first person to make this comparison, I suspect I won\\'t be the only one to conclude that, despite many strengths, Kill Shakespeare proves wanting. \\n Series creators Conor McCreery and Anthony Del Col have a demonstrable affection for this material, but will irk many readers with short comings in both textual understanding and language. Most crucially of all, the writers rarely make the creative leap into taking these well known characters in directions that are both novel and engaging (Iago and Lady Macbeth being two delightful exceptions). More often than not, the writers move these iconic characters in the opposite direction, reducing their depth in the service a rather convoluted narrative. \\n These criticisms may be made harsher by a combination of my love of Shakespeare and my high expectations of this book. This series grasps at such a high concept that success was almost certain to prove elusive. On occasion, the action and dialogue proves amusing.

Part of that is the fact that two of the four arcs are big cross-overs, but even without that, it jumps from place-to-place with little concern for explaining continuity to you. This is sort of a wonderful spine to the VH-E universe, but the whole is less than the parts. \\n To Kill a King (1-4). I previously read these as part of the crossover collected in X-O Manowar Deluxe Volume 2,so I was curious if they were comprehensible on their own. The answer quite surprisingly was yes. Some of the background context is clearly missing. You can also tell there was some activity between issues 2 and 3. However everything is fairly well-explained, and otherwise this is a set of seamless issues. Valiant continues to do a rather excellent job of creating crossovers that actually read well on their own. \\n The Unity issues don't have the same emotional depth as the X-O issues, perhaps because we're seeing a larger cast of characters and perhaps because they're just coming together. However, I love the global scope of this comic, and I love how dynamic it is. If both of these elements continue, then it should become great as Kindt becomes more comfortable with the characters [7/10]. \\n Trapped by Webnet (5-7).

He's still al little too megalomaniacal, but otherwise he's been reimagined in an interesting way. The plot again is nicely global, and though it seems overly compressed, it's otherwise a nice continuation of the Unity team [6+/10]. \\n Armor Hunters (8-11). Unity is clearly a subsidiary comic in the Armor Hunters arc, but it stays involved with the big picture of the evolving story, making it more successful than the Armor Hunters mini-series, which tended to get a little small and specific. Ninjak and Livewire are both put to very good use. Ninjak is depicted as an interesting, multi-faceted character, while Kindt really has fun with Livewire's machine empathy (almost, but not quite, to the point of success). The result is overall a fun read as part of the Armor Hunters crossover. \\n Unfortunately, as a standalone volume, Unity V3 is largely a failure. The story is entirely incoherent, without a start or an end, and little explanation of how we get from one issue to another. Though I love how the characters are spotlighted as part of the Armor Hunters crossover, if read on its own, this is a muddled mess ... which is a darned shame, because Valiant is offering it as if were a comprehensible standalone book, both in Unity V3 and Unity Deluxe V1.

The whole Marvel Family receives a similar treatment with surprising results. Most intriguing of all is Johns\\' work on Captain Marvel\\'s villains. Dr. Sivana - that stereotype evil scientist (white coat and all!) - was previously as flat as his rival. Here Johns does for that villain what he previously did for Black Adam, recasting a one-note afterthought into an interesting character with complex motivations. It is too early to know if this new Sivana will gain the following of Johns\\' Black Adam, but I would not be surprised if other writers pick him up and run with him into new stories. \\n As before, Johns seems particularly interested in this character\\'s magical elements and Gary Frank\\'s art style matches well with that interest. He offers the right combination of the real and the fantastical, his lines bold and he does particularly strong work capturing the movement on the page. Like the best artists, he makes you not only want to keep reading, but to reread and examine. \\n Mister Mind already put in an appearance elsewhere in the New 52. Still, few heroes can claim as rich a rogues\\' gallery as Captain Marvel. No doubt Johns will have a field day (can Captain Nazi and King Kull be far behind?) remaking each. I for one am just thrilled to be along for the ride.

His overly wordy, fight-heavy stories might have still been appropriate in the '80s, but by '00 the style was stale (let alone now). I also don't know what the deal was with the X-Men being scattered, no one being worried about missing members, and those missing members seemingly missing for huge amounts of time. I'd swear that Polaris and Havoc spent a year wandering the Savage Land in an air car. \\n Beyond that, Byrne's integration with the historical eras that he's writing in is uninspiring. He manages to totally undercut classic stories like the battle against the Z'Nox, and is also really repetitive with stories like Magneto-in-the-Savage-Land (again!). And instead of offering interesting foreshadowing for future stories, he rather ham-handedly does things like letting the X-Men meet a young Storm and having Jean Gray dream about the Phoenix -- things that clearly couldn't have happened given later continuity. \\n Finally, when Byrne introduces new things, they don't really tend to fit with the style of X-Men stories, such as dull alien races that are generally pretty interchangeable. \\n In short: The Hidden Years don't seem to add anything interesting to the X-Men canon, and that makes them a failure in my eyes, as I think that's the point of a retcon series like this. \\n Byrne seems to have a style of writing nowadays that he uses for everything, and though it's occasionally interesting, it sometimes comes off very inappropriately, as is the case here. \\n I'd looked forward to these two reprints of The Hidden Years, but definitely won't be buying the second one (or keeping this one).\"),\n",

They\\'re evocative and eye-opening, promising a larger story than what we saw. But in the end, I\\'m not sure how critical that larger view was. You could almost read the series without it. \\n Then we get \"Pray for Rain\", another period piece, and one of the best in large part because we get a more sizable cast, and then we get to see what happens when Jo uses her witchy magic on them. (It\\'s also nice to get such strong connections to the modern-day.) \\n Finally, the ending, \"Curse the Demon\", closes out our frame by bringing us the modern day. It isn\\'t as strong as any of the previous volumes, because the mysterious is made matter-of-fact and the dangers we edged around before are brought to the center. Maybe if I cared more about Jo or Nick, I\\'d find this fulfilling. As is, it\\'s just the inevitable end to the story. \\n So, I admire the structure of Fatale, and I love its view of past time periods, but I think the main plot somewhat outstayed its welcome and when it comes to an end the story doesn\\'t have a lot that\\'s unexpected.'),\n",

But when this new friend, who happens to be a hydra, gets carried away with pranks that are hurtful to others, Squish must make a decision. Friendship dynamics are so relevant for the targeted age group; as children pull away from their parents, they must navigate the muddy waters of peer pressure. Not all children can do this as well as Squish, who shows remarkable courage in this story. Bravo to the Holms for taking on this topic and for weaving it so well into Squish's world. \\n Another graphic novel series by the Holm siblings, aimed at chapter book readers, but the Squish series doesn't have the magic of the Babymouse books. All the characters in this series are microorganisms. The color scheme is black, white, and green, since this series targets boys. Squish, an amoeba, loves comic books, especially his favorite superhero, Super Amoeba. It's a strength of this series, and a tribute to the power of literature in children's lives (yes, comic books are children's literature, too), that the issue of Super Amoeba that Squish is reading parallels whatever is going on in Squish's own life.

       "  \"This volume necessarily kicks off with the dissolution of the Old Defenders -- Strange, Namor, Surfer, and the Hulk. It's a kind of heavy-handed removal that notably changes the focus of the book. But it does have one great element: the return of the Elf from several years previous, with an explanation for what he was doing. Yay for continuity! (Unfortunately, that's almost the last great thing in this volume.) \\n Hellcat and Hellstrom are just as unceremoniously shuffled off the board, with a big marriage that super villains must of course attack. Meanwhile, the Scarlet Witch and the Vision decide not to join up. And that's perhaps the biggest problem with the New Defenders: it feels like a different comic than the old one because of this major revamp, with Gargoyle and the Valkyrie being the only long-term characters. \\n Meanwhile, the new members of the team are an odd lot. Moondragon would have been a good addition to any Defenders team, but the use of old X-Men for half the cast, including Beast, Angel, and Iceman, feels a rather odd decision. Mind you, DeMatteis does well with these characters. And perhaps, they should be taken on the basis of who they are, and how well they're characterized, not who they aren't. \\n The New Defenders' first major plotline unfortunately seems to match with the idea that they're now a much more normative super team. It's not just that they're fighting the Secret Empire, but that they're fighting a Secret Empire which seems stripped of the conspiratorial tomfoolery from Captain America and the Avengers. Instead, the Empire is now hiring the super-villain team of the month to fight the Defenders. Five words highlight how low the Defenders have fallen by this point: Mad-Dog and the Mutant Force. Like the choice to make a team that's half X-Men ... it's bizarre. (And it's not cool, non-team bizarre.) \\n I suppose you could argue that the strange new Secret Empire is explained by the revelation that it's led by Professor Power ... but it still feels like a betrayal of the original Secret Empire. And Professor Power could be a bad 1980s action figure. Worse, his appearance doesn't really fit with the earlier uses of the Secret Empire in this comic either. He hates the X-Men, so ... he tries to abduct the Vision and disrupt Daimon and Patsy's wedding ...? (Step Two: Profit!) \\n At least the Secret Empire plotline gives us Cloud as a character; she's one of the more interesting elements of this New Defenders era ... a real groundbreaker in later issues. But, she's one of the few highlights. The rest of the Professor Power arc (126-130) is quite bad, full of endless fighting, cliches, and worse. When Beast announces that the New Defenders have a government clearance, it's obvious that DeMatteis ain't actually writing the Defenders any more. \\n Overall, this is a mediocre, to bad volume. The finale of the Old Defenders is decent other than the authorial mandate to throw out the old, but most of the New Defenders stories are pretty bad. The last issue, with its more humorous bent (foreshadowing DeMatteis' work on the JL comic) is more interesting, but then DeMatteis leaves, having realized he's ruined his own interest in the comic too. \\n So, can the next writer (Peter Gillis) do any better ... ?\"),\n",

That\\'s what actually took me the longest to read; for quite a while I just read 5 or 6 pages right before bed.

I only know a small amount about the Cultural Revolution of Iran in 1979, read about it briefly and I've seen a couple movies that take place in Iran. I think even only one of those was actually during that time. But what a terrifying period in the country's history. \\n This follows Marji from the age of 10 to the age of 14 when she leaves Iran. She was the only child of a very well-to-do family that had empirical ties and wealth and class. They were very political, and only slightly religious, definitely progressive. From this point of view, you get a child's perspective on events both within her family, but in the country as a whole. You can see how the origins of the revolution were Marxist but it eventually fell into a theological Islamic fundamentalism. Things were bad, then they got worse, then they got really worse. Marji, while being exposed to events much more than probably the standard pre-teen of the time, was largely in the dark and confused. She dealt with it the best she could. \\n The story was at times heart breaking, at times rather humorous, and almost always quite engaging. It was generally linear, but broke into something like mini-chapters to speak on a specific subject at a time. At first I didn't care for this format, but grew to like it. It did make the story somewhat disjointed at times, but overall it was pretty good. I learned a lot about the history of the country and the turmoil of the early 1980s. \\n The artwork was okay, nothing spectacular. It was black and white (which my kids thought was boring) and very simple. It was drawn as if it was drawn by the child writing the story. I'm not sure if Satrapi always illustrates in this style, but it was fitting for the subject, I thought, like right out of her diary. The paneling was generally standard, with occasional deviations. At times there were really nice patterns with repetition, reminiscent of the bas relief sculptures of Persian history. Sometimes, especially when all the females wore veils, it was difficult to discern who was who. \\n This is a seminal work that should be on every good graphic novel shelf.

I love anything having to do with mythology of any kind, so the synopsis had me hooked before I even dived in. I was surprised and excited about the amount of gods represented in this story. It is not just the typical gods we see in a lot of fiction, such as the Greek pantheon, but many other 'lesser known' gods from other cultures were also represented. Surprising no one, my favorites were the cthonic gods, of which there are a plethora to choose from in this world. \\n Many people have said they found this first volume confusing, but I disagree.

Yes, it\\'s the truth, I\\'m reviewing only16 chapters today, or 7 volumes. There are 16 volumes in total with 68 chapters. It will be at least another year until it will be fully translated on my favourite manga reading website. But enough with my gloomy narrations. Let\\'s get to the story, try to hook you onto it so when you finish we\\'ll make a \"waiting-for -an-update\" club. *grins. \\n The story will follow Kyounosuke - a son of a famous Kabuki household. Wait, you have no idea what Kabuki is? Well, it\\'s a Japanese theatre, where only men can play. Yes, even the women roles are played by men. If you want to know more about it, you can ask google-sensei. So, I hope you\\'ll look into it, but I\\'ll be moving on. Don\\'t forget that it\\'s a love story, and we have a very strange love triangle or I can even call it a square. So, let\\'s establish it.

Hiro-kun or Hiroyuki (I hope, I\\'m saying his name correctly here). He\\'s also n Kabuki, however, he is not a descendant of a well-established family. And lastly Yuna - a young lady of the house where Hiro-kun is apprenticed. Are you ready to build our love square? Let\\'s start Kyou-chan falls in love with Ayame at the first sight, but he gets rejected, so who does Ayame love? She loves her childhood friend - Hiro-kun, but hasn\\'t seen him in a long time. Is this also an unrequited love? There\\'s the conflict of interests. It seems he does love her, but he still uses Yuna to achieve his goals. And lastly we have Yuna who is head over heels in love with Hiro-kun. So, here you go a love square! \\n But that\\'s enough with describing these love affairs. For 26 chapters there are a lot of things happening. We get to see how all characters develop either into their better or worse self. We\\'re surely looking at Kyou\\'s rapid development. Though his idiotic faces were back in the last chapter, however, he totally deserves that happiness of being near Ayame, he worked for his love! Ooops... am I spilling too much here? I hope not... the character that made me laugh was surely Ayame, when she finally understands her true feelings it\\'s so interesting! I mean, I was finally having a celebration that her thick headiness has been breached. And lastly my least favourite character. Surely Hiro-kun and Yuna. I hated ojou-sama right away, she was a typical woman, that I hate reading in the mangas about. And while in the beginning I supported Hiro-kun, in the end he disgusted me all together.

Though the two are similar in that they take a very random approach to humour with unique ideas and characters, God Hates Astronauts lacks the childish sense of delight within its writing that makes the random nature of the plot cohesive and enjoyable. \\n Written and illustrated by Ryan Browne, God Hates Astronauts is about a superhero team that works for NASA. But rather than wasting all their time saving the world, the self-absorbed superheroes prefer to focus on their libidos, bizarre supervillains, and loitering aliens. The narrative is all over the place and tends to focus on one situation at a time rather than any overarching plot. This is not necessarily a bad thing, as plenty of graphic novels and comic books do this, especially in the comedic genre. \\n What makes this narrative less successful is that a lot of the jokes are based on gendered humour, meant to parody the sexism of the 1950s. But the parody isn't reflected enough in the other aspects of the book, such as the villains or setting, so the humour falls flat and just comes off as sexist. \\n The art, also done by Browne, is very classical with defined lines and heavy inks, but is coloured in a more modern way with smooth tones. Aesthetically it's a good combination, and his balance between cartoon and realism make the art extremely dynamic. \\n All in all, I appreciate this book for its fun art style, but I can't recommend it. \\n cross posted from the Other Press\"),\n",

But it's Bruce and Alfred who really steal the show. I love this frankly bad-ass version of the loyal butler. He's not particularly sold on Bruce's path, but he's determined to keep Bruce safe. Their dynamic is refreshing. As well, here we see a Bruce Wayne that's probably more realistic. I mean, let's face it. This is a man who grew up wealthy and privilege. He's going to be arrogant. He's going to be blinded by his own vision. He can't do it all, so he relies on Alfred for viciousness, Gordon for detective skills, and Fox for tech. What he does have it courage and strength. I'm curious to see where this story goes.\"),\n",

       "  \"I was somewhat surprised to discover that Ninjak is James Bond to the point of being bad pastiche. The only thing that really makes him stand out is that he's darker and more manipulative (at least when compared to movie Bond). \\n This storytelling is also incredibly muddy, something that's not helped by the muddy Quesada art, the whole result being a comic that's hard to follow. It picks up a bit with the X-O crossover, but King's side of things is still awkward to follow. The 0 issues that follow are the height of the book, but it's not enough to save a book which generally felt like a dull waste of time that was largely incomprehensible. \\n I don't see any reason to continue on with this Valiant Classic.\"),\n",

       "  \"Just like what is happening to Scott Snyder in All-Star Batman, superstar artist Greg Capullo does not deserve Mark Millar's lackluster writing and mediocre story. Reborn has come to a point that only the art alone makes this series a worthwhile read. I understand that Reborn is meant to be an easy reading dark-high fantasy story, a nod to classic fiction where not everything is ought to be explained with complex expositions. But Reborn has so many holes and bad dialogues that I don't anymore care about what will happen. \\n Reborn's story has become convenient and way too predictable. It is like Millar has lost all the inspiration and writes it just because he has to. Bonnie's quest to find his husband has dragged the series for a long time. Just show us a good vs. evil large-scale battle! \\n Greg Capullo's awesome art unfortunately is paired with a hugely underwhelming story. \\n The chemistry between Bonnie and his father hasn't even worked until now. I mean, of all the topics she can open up, Bonnie's conversation with his dad about her period and hysterectomy is utterly awkward and cringeworthy. \\n It is sad that Reborn started out good and now it is reduced to a disjointed literary piece. At least the art is still consistently great.\"),\n",
